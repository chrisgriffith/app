Sync Studios and Cool Earth have partnered together to create an all time first in app technology for the iPhone and iPod Touch connecting you with the rainforest. Once you have planted your Virtual tree, help raise it to a huge wonder of nature by managing its water, light, pollination and fruit, and help protect it from loggers and other threats. Once you have grown and protected your tree, you can view your real tree's location via satellite through Google-Maps from within the app.
