Harmonious is a “smart” sketchpad that uses the lines you've already drawn to influence new lines. You can create some really artistic pieces and then upload them to the harmoniousapp.com gallery site. It uses the Harmony library from Mrdoob, jQTouch for interactions and the Glyphish icons, then wraps the whole thing up in PhoneGap
