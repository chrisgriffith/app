This application, which is based on the yearly and just-completed Mavericks big wave surf contest off the coast of Northern California, is a timely and interactive application that shows off many of the benefits of the Sony Ericsson WebSDK based on the Phonegap framework. This includes on-screen alerts about when the contest happens, GPS- integrated Google Maps integration, dynamic weather maps, stored surfer profiles, a link to a music tour and music store, and a live Twitter feed.
