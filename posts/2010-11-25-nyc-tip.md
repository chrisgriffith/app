NYC Tip is a tip calculator, useful when dining out in New York City. It allows you to discreetly calculate the final price to pay; including the standard tipping percentages (15/18/20%) of New York restaurants, bars, or taxis. When dining out, or enjoying the city in large groups, this streamlined application makes tipping easy, and less stressful. Which we all know, saves time and keeps the good times going. The final amount is rounded, so that it is faster for you to leave the tip of your choice.
