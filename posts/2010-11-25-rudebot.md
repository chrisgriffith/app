Meet RudeBot, the bad-mannered insulting bot! RudeBot used to be a friendly robot, but unfortunately, years of abandonment and a build up of rust has meant that things have really got under his skin. His circuitry has become very sensitive and he has started to malfunction. Kicked to the curb, RudeBot now spends most of his time hurling insults at passers by.
