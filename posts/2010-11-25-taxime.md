TaxiMe uses Google Maps to estimate how much your taxi fare will cost. All you need to do is enter your starting address and your final destination! TaxiMe contains the taxi rates for various cities across Canada and the US.  It uses your current GPS coordinates and uses the appropriate taxi rates for the city you're currently in.
