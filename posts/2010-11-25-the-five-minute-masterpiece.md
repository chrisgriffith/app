The Five Minute Masterpiece is a fun, clean, easy to use multi-touch finger painting program. Simple to use - choose from a palette of 25 colors and get messy (on the screen). You can save finished paintings to your Photo Album and even 'replay' your current painting and watch it playback before your eyes!
