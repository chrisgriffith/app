XCamera is an open source project under the Apache license (ALv2) on OpenNTF.Org. The app takes pictures using the smartphone's camera and then uploads the picture into a IBM Lotus Domino database. Technically the Lotus Domino programming model XPages is used which leverages web standards like HTML, JavaScript, CSS and JSF and provides rapid application development mechanisms on top of it.
