Welcome to Chester the Cat's Spelling Farm, where your 4-6 year old spells the names of farm animals and objects by using their finger to drag and drop “refrigerator magnet letters” into place!
When your child spells a word correctly, the farm comes to life with sound &amp; movement.
Spell ALL the words, and Chester the Cat gets a saucer of fresh milk from Don the Farmer!
