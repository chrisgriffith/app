Groupix is the first cross platform app that allows you to create collaborative photo albums in real-time.

With Groupix, you first create a shared photo album amongst friends, then photos taken from each of your friend's smartphones are automatically stored in the shared album and are immediately viewable by all of the album's members.

At any time, you can visit http://grpix.com/ to view and download the collaborative photo album.
