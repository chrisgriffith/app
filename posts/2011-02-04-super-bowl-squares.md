Our Super Bowl Squares app takes actual game data from 1994-2010 and determines which squares have historically been the most successful. Since the pools can vary from party to party we also let you enter your particular party's payout scheme (100% at the end of the game or some percentage paid out each quarter) and recompute the best squares based on your payout.

Then as the game as played you can update the score at the end of each quarter to determine the most likely winners from that point
