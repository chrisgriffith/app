Boxing Coach is the perfect partner for your heavy bag boxing or martial arts training. Not only does it do all the things your typical boxing timer does keep track of your round time, prep/rest times, give you audio feedback to start/end rounds. Boxing Coach will actually count your punches/kicks and keep track of your punching tempo during the round.
