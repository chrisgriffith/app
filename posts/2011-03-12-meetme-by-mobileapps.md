MeetMe lets you send your location to your contacts. Using the location technologies in your device, MeetMe finds where you are and defines your physical address to the current longitude/latitude. Type in the phone number of the recipient and MeetMe sends a SMS/text message to your contact!

Note: You must have email setup on your device for MeetMe to work. MeetMe uses email to send the SMS so you are not charged a fee.
