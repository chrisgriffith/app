This program was created to be used as a QUICK REFERENCE for physicians, sonographers, and other health care professionals who would like to compute gestational age during the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy. In addition the estimated fetal weight can be computed and fetal growth (HC, AC, FL, Weight, HC/AC) as well as amniotic fluid can be evaluated with graphical analysis. This program does not store patient information and cannot be used for generating a printed report. However, its value may be in the clinic, emergency room, hospital setting, labor and delivery, or other venue in which instant information regarding the above measurements is desirable.
