Focusizer is a tool used to help you get things done using the Pomodoro Technique - a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. 

The technique uses a timer to break down periods of work into 25-minute intervals called 'pomodoros' (from the Italian word for 'tomato') separated by breaks. 

There are five basic steps to implementing this technique: 

1. decide the task to be done 
2. start Focusizer 
2. work until Focusizer chimes 
4. take a break until Focusizer alerts you 
5. get things done 

Focusizer also lets you track how many distractions you've had during each pomodoro period, with the goal being to get these distractions to zero. 

Let's get to work!
