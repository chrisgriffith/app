Photovoltaique pro is the extension of the free Photovoltaique iphone application.

It uses the internal GPS and compass to calculate how much you can expect from your photovoltaic installation in France.

Moreover, the Pro versions allows you to calculate how many photovoltaic modules you can install on your roof, depending on the available size of the roof and on the PV modules type.
