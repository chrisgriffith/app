On a warm Christmas Eve night in a quiet Louisiana bayou, a cheerful waterfowl named Goose is ambushed by vengeful hillbillies after he honks in joy for the imminent arrival of Santa Claus. After a bizarre journey to a lonely abyss, Goose is summoned back to reality as the hillbillies rejoin their family for a disgusting yuletide feast. The dinner soon turns from satisfying to sickening when Goose returns in a glorious explosion to teach the hillbillies about holiday cheer and the terrible consequence of being rude to strangers.

The Christmas Goose is an illustrated tale told through detailed photographs reminiscent of a childâ€™s storybook. Filled with handmade clay sculptures, exquisite settings and moody sound effects, Goose is a twisted, adult-oriented fable that's fun any time of the year.
