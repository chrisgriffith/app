Back pain affects both the pain sufferer and their loved ones. With the pain comes decreased activity, frustration and problems with intimacy.
But now back pain sufferers and their partners can rejoice! BackTogether Interactive will provide you with the information and hands-on tools you need to decrease and even banish your pain --together! This unique app, based upon Dr. Andrew Kirschner's popular book, DVD and live seminars utilizes beautifully shot videos and animated text to instruct you on how to perform simple, safe and effective hands-on techniques to relieve back and neck pain.

A wonderful feature is an in-app link to the newly launched Back Together Forum (Internet connection required.) This great feature enables you to share your experiences performing these techniques with others doing the same-- allowing users to exchange information and suggestions. In the forum, you can also submit questions to Dr. Kirschner and his associates.

Featuring music generously provided by DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; Howard Jones, this app was coded by possibly the youngest-ever app developer for the iPad, 9 year old Jesse Friedman.

Features:

-Over 90 minutes of beautifully produced native video (no internet connection required.)

-A video introduction to the art of palpation.

-Clear descriptions allowing you to become an expert on applying these simple and effective techniques.

-Links to subforums for each of the techniques described (internet connection required.)

-A brief anatomy review for laypersons unfamiliar with some of the structures described in the videos.

-A great asset for osteopathic medical students, chiropractors, physical therapists, massage therapists, and anyone else wishing to learn great soft tissue techniques to add to their pain management arsenal.
