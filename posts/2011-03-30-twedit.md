TWEdit provides a way to edit and save Tiddlywiki (www.tiddlywiki.com) wiki files on iOS. 

TWEdit uses PhoneGap for all of the interactions with iOS - in particular for file i/o. PhoneGap is a critical component in the solution simply because Tiddlywiki is written in javascript, and PhoneGap provides the most practical way of getting from javascript to the OS.
