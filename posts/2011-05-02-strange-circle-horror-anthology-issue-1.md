ALL NEW HORROR ANTHOLOGY<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the first issue of the Strange Circle magazine, an anthology of new horror fiction and poetry.<br/>
<br/>
The fourteen contributions are the darkest and most disturbing that crossed our desk, and we present them to you with gusto. The fayre ranges from flash fiction to short fiction, and introduces us to murderers and monsters alike.<br/>
<br/>
(O+&lt;)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Strange Circle surrounds us all, and our duty is to find a way through to the other side. The creative act is a violent blow<br/>
