The binary clock displays the current time in hours, minutes and seconds, whereas each value is represented by a single row. The first row represents the hours, the second row the minutes and the third and last row represents the seconds. Filled (green) and empty squares are used to display the binary values 1 and 0. A filled square represents 1, an empty square represents 0. The different bit places are read from right to left.
