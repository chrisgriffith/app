TEXT2IMAGE is an net.artwork by Ted Davis that explores the nature of our digital media, specifically the JPEG image format. Through the literal combination of text and image, a new meaning and visual reference is given to any word, phrase, story you can think of. Within the realms of cross-media visualization and glitch aesthetics, TEXT2IMAGE investigates alternative ways to create an image and analyze texts.
