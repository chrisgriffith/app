GeoTipper is designed to take the guesswork out of tipping for services while traveling all across the globe. Whether you’re drinking a pint in a Irish pub, taking a taxi in Morocco, or getting a bite to eat in Nepal, GeoTipper can help you decide the appropriate gratuity.  In less words, it’s a cheatsheet for global tipping etiquette.<br />
<br />
GeoTipper was built with Jquery Mobile.  It utilizes Phonegap's NativeControls plug-in to provide native feeling navigation for the end-user.
