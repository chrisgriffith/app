2011 officially marks the year that AthFest is going mobile, with the release of the official Athfest iPhone app. The AthFest app puts the power of organization right in the palm of your hand, with interactive features such as a scrollable version of this year's lineup that is sortable by date and venue, a map of downtown athens, band pages with the low-down on each band, and a personal schedule, fully customized by your choice of shows.
