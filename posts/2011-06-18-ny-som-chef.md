This app is in Swedish developed for the Swedish union/association Svensk Chefsförening (Swedish manager association) and primarily for those who are about to become a manager, for negotiations with prospective employer. It is also useful for managers who intend to change jobs, and towards negotiations on wages and conditions.<br />
<br />
It is published both as an iPhone/iPad version and an Android version and contains a wealth of tips and advice for the negotiations as well as salary statistics.
