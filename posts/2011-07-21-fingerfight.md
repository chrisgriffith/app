Finger Fight is a speedy game utilizing a single iPhone/iPad for a 2 player game. The game is based on the real-life physical game of Slapsies (also known as red hands or hand-slap game) where two players continuously switch roles as either attacker or escaper.<br />
<br />
The goal of the game is to be faster than your opponent. The screen is split in two, and players switch roles as either attacking or escaping depending on who wins.
