The Newport Folk Festival is the grand-daddy of folk festivals. One of the most endearing traits of the weekend-long celebration is the spontaneous, organic way in which things happen. The goal of this app was not only to be a companion to festival-goers in a traditional sense (schedules, artist bios and festival map) but also to be that little angel on their shoulder that lets them know their favorite artist just grabbed their instruments and is playing a few acoustic tunes down by the water.
