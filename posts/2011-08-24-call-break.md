Call Break is a strategic trick-based card game played by four players with a standard deck of 52 playing cards. The game is very similar to other trick-based game especially Spades. In Call Break the term "hand" is used instead of trick, and "Call" is used instead of bid. After each deal player have to make a "Call" or "bid" for the number of hands he/she can capture, and the objective is to capture at least that many hand in a round, and try to break other player.
