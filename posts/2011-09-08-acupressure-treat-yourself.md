"Acupressure: Treat Yourself" is easy to use app with illustrated instructions how to make acupressure point massage.
Acupressure is an ancient healing art that uses the fingers to press key points on the surface of the skin to stimulate the body's natural self-curative abilities. When these points are pressed, they release muscular tension and promote the circulation of blood and the body's life force to aid healing.
Foremost among the advantages of acupressure's healing touch is that it is safe to do on yourself and others - even if you've never done it before. You can also use self-acupressure to relieve anxiety and to help you get to sleep at night.
