With almost 300 ski resorts piste explorer is the perfect accompaniment to your next ski / snowboard / hiking holiday. Piste / Trail Maps can be downloaded before you go away so you never need to worry about not having signal or costly data roaming charges.
If your device supports gps you can locate yourself on the map and never take a wrong turn again on a poorly labelled piste.
