Putting fun first when teaching children maths, feels like a shopkeeper simulation game so you child won't even know they are learning! Covers counting and adding numbers up to 20.

Built with phonegap in order to develop for multiple platforms (in due course), but also to make use of the power of webkit.

If you are a phonegap developer, or are considering using phonegap for your next project, check it out to see how phonegap can be used for non standard apps, and possibly some inspiration :).
