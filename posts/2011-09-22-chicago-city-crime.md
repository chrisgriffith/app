Chicago City Crime is a web and mobile application for tourists and residents of Chicago. The application displays crimes near the user's location using the device's location sensor and preferences configurable by the user. The total number of crimes are displayed to the user, which he or she can click on to view a breakdown of the different types of crimes in his or her area. Chicago City Crime was built with jQuery mobile, Phonegap, flot, and the Google Maps API.
