BikeFlux is a cycling navigation application that allows you to navigate to wherever you want in a cycling friendly way. Your route is shown on the map and you can see your speed and location while cycling.<br />
<br />
While you are cycling, BikeFlux is registering the distance you've cycled, your top and average speed. Afterwards this data will be sent automatically to the BikeFlux website.<br />
<br />
You can also watch the total distance you have cycled on your profile page.
