Learn sign language to chat and flirt at death metal concerts and loud bars!<br />
<br />
This application is targeted to those familiar with at least the alphabet and some signs. Using SignWriting, an ideographic writing system for sign language, we store over 8000 signs on your device without the need for an Internet connection. The icons communicate hand shape, context and movement, but there are no illustrations or videos.
