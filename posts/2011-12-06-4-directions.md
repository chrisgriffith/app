***Play the most arcade, minimal, glitch, psychedelic game of the app store!!!*** <br />
<br />
At home, in the office, at the bus stop, on the train, in the street, at the doctor's, in the bank, in the bathroom, while you are waiting for your latecomer girlfriend, etc. The simplicity of «4 directions» will captivate you wherever you are! <br />
<br />
Brief description of the game:<br />
<br />
In the game screen there are 4 buttons, that indicate a different direction, in the centre after a few seconds appears a sign that indicates a direction and then the button to press...too easy? ... no!...as the score increases, the position of the button changes all the time...but is not all...try to believe!!!!
