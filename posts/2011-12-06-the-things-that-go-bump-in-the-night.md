type: app
---

The first text adventure game specifically designed for iPhone and Android.<br />
<br />
In this game, you are a security guard settling down to a quiet night shift, when things start to go wrong. You must make your way around the compound, solving puzzles and dispatching mysterious beasts.<br />
<br />
Unlike the text adventures of old, this new type of text adventure can be played without any typing. Instead, you can use links and menus to navigate and interact with the game.
