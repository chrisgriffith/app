spotmouth, because every spot has a story to tell. Use spotmouth to read what others have said for where you are now.

How do you use spotmouth?

First, set the location. This doesn't have to be where you currently are, but rather, what area you are interested in. Once your location is set, you will be able to see the spots the are currently available. If a spot hasn't been created yet for your favorite bar or restaurant, you can create it and give that spot it's voice.

Spots can be anything. Stores, or a spot on a sidewalk. Anything at all.

For any spot, you can view postings for it. Postings are written by people for a spot, a posting can be what they thought of their experience, a coupon for the spot (e.g. buy one, get one free), and even a password-protected hidden treasure! You will need to provide the password to spot to get your treasure.

Follow spots. Register for an account, and if anyone posts something to a spot that you follow, you get an email notification.

Spots and stories can be freely tagged and searched by tag. Keyword search is also available
