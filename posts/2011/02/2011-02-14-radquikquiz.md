RadQuikQuiz was developed to allow rapid and efficient review of radiology. It also allows for quick review and testing of human anatomy (select volumes). This application was developed by Woojin Kim, MD. For example, radiology residents can use this application to prepare for boards. Rapid Image Review is designed like a set of flashcards that you can use to quickly review various image-based cases. Each quiz set consists of 10 questions. There are two quiz modes: 1) Review and 2) Test. In the “Review” mode, you will be able to see the correct answer after each question. In the “Test” mode, you will receive no feedback until the end of the quiz.
