The KHSAA/Riherds.com Scoreboard is the official source of schedules and scores for the 279 member schools of the Kentucky High School Athletic Association (KHSAA). The Scoreboard covers Football, Boys and Girls Soccer, Volleyball, Boys and Girls Basketball, Baseball and Fast Pitch Softball. 

This app contains schedules and scores from the current season (2010-2011) and may be browsed by sport, date and team. 

The Scoreboard application comes pre-loaded with a complete copy of the database of over 24,000 schedules/scores from the current season. Since the data is stored inside the application there is no need to have internet connectivity to browse the database. The database is automatically updated when the application is running and an internet connection is available. 

The Scoreboard is a cooperation between Riherds.com, LLC of Smiths Grove, Kentucky and the Kentucky High School Athletic Association.
