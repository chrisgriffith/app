Anagram, gramana, magrana - how many words can you make from the letters of another word.

This app lets you put that question to rest. Using the letters "DESIGN MATTERS." you can arrange these into numerous different combinations of words.

Create two, three or four word sets using all the letters and then share them with other wordsmiths online. Be the first to create a new combination of letters, submit it to us and we'll post it on our blog.

This is a fun challenge for all, and you'll be amazed at just how many clever, silly and funny combinations of words are possible from this set of letters.

How To Play:
1. Drag and drop the letters into place.
2. Capture your anagram into your gallery.
3. Select image and submit to us.

Tip:
Use the "." as an abbreviation or apostrophe.
