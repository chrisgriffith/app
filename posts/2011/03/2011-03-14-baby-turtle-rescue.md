The baby turtles keep getting flipped on their shells and only you can help. Touch the turtles to flip them over, but be carful not to startle the surrounding babies.

How To Play:

This is a maddening puzzle game in which youâ€™re trying to flip all of the baby turtles on the screen. However, every time you turn one over on their feet, others get scared and flip on their shells. So how are you going to rescue the baby turtles and get them all back on their feet?
