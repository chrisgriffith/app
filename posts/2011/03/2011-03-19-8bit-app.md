Use your webcam or DSLR camera to capture 8bit holographs that are made with your iPhone/iPad. Simply type in your message, add 8bit space invader characters, choose colors, adjust exposure time, and set depth. You then slide your iPhone/iPad slowly to either side to capture the holograph with your camera. See/contribute to the flickr group at http://flickr.com/groups/8bit
