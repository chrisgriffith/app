Ever wondered if there was a pattern to your days where you felt anger or other negative emotions? Looking to find a way to live life a little happier by finding and removing negative influences? Or you're interested in living a life that's a little more biblically correct?

Fruits of the Spirit, based on Galatians 5 in the bible, allows you to track the good days and bad days you have, and provides a way for you to go back in time to look at your patterns later, along with notes you provide. Think of it as a super charged journal for your emotions and actions throughout the day!

While it's primarily intended for Christians, Messianic Jews, and other Believers, it's also a great tool for those who are non-religious to get in better touch with the patterns they live by, and hopefully learn to avoid those patterns. Learn to live life as happily as possible!
