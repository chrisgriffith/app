Inspired by the arcade hit "whack-a-mole" this version delivers the same heart pumping action but with an educational twist. In order to actually "hit" the mole you not only have to whack it with your finger but you must answer a math question. Math-a-Mole Ultimate supports: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division. You may select which one or more math operations to quiz on. The game starts with single digit math and ramps up to three digit arithmetic.
