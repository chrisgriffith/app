title: Wondering about Wandering
type: app
---

This app was created to help caregivers with loved ones suffering from Alzheimer's disease, or other forms of dementia (PWD).
This app provides educational information to prepare a home to make it more difficult for your loved one to wander, and it is a platform to record information about loved ones, that can be used to assist in locating them when / if they wander.
This content was developed by the staff of Dementia Care Coaching, and the app was developed by ISI Software.

They will also be able to save a profile of the PWD that can be provided to law enforcement and the community to assist in locating a missing PWD.
