Real Short Good Short URL is a URL shrinker and more. It does not only allow you to shrink URLs, but you have also the possibility to give a preferred name. So you can create links which are meaningful instead of a combination of characters. http://rs.gs/iPhone tells you more then http://rs.gs/xDsA2.
After creating a short URL, the program copies the new URL to the clipboard! So you can directly paste the new link! Another great feature is that it keeps your own history of the URLs you shrinked!
