Splash Math is a fun and innovative way to practice math. With 16 chapters covering over 200 math skills and an endless supply of problems it is by far the most comprehensive math workbook in the app store. All of the included problems are aligned with state standards for 3rd grade. The content is highly interactive. Children drag and drop shapes, pop bubbles, rotate clock hands and more to solve problems.
