Creature Mixup is a silly kids app. Simple, clean fun that kids seem to really love. My five kids love playing with it even with its limited feature set. Right now only an iPhone version is available but an Android version is finished and working its way through the Android Market, a Blackberry version is being finalized, and an iPad version is in the works.<br/>
