"Landmarks: San Francisco" helps tourists, tour guides, architects, historic preservationists, urban planners, realtors, and renters &amp; homebuyers find the city's architectural gems -- from the Golden Gate Bridge to the City Lights Bookstore.  The app lists the official landmarked buildings and sites near you, anywhere in the city, showing detailed info for each one. You can view the locations on a map, and email details about the site. Built with PhoneGap and jQTouch.
