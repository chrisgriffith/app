Owl Post is a service which delivers your “notes” to the opposite sex near you, around your age, anonymously.<br />
<br />
Your owl won’t spill your name. Also it will reduce the possibility of spams greatly, because it will be exhausted by the time it gets home after flying through a bunch of people without getting any responses.<br />
<br />
But beware, if you choose to ignore a note rather than replying to it, the owl will not be able to (unless you are extremely lucky) find the exact same person again.
