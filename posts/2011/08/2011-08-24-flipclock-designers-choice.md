With FlipClock you have choosen a different way to experience current time: Relaxed and elaborate it tells you the time like a friend would do. So it's not just exactly "10:03:45", but "just after ten. "<br />
Swiping opens the preferences window in which the flip sound can be disabled or the integrated alarm set.<br />
If the alarm is active, the classic beep-sound can be switched off by double tapping the device. A single tap activates the "Snooze" function, which suspends the alarm for ten minutes.
