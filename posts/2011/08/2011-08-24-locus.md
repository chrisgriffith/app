Shortcode based GPS navigation system:<br />
Help people get to a location with the handiness of a short code.<br />
Find your location on the locus submission page (http://locus.anon.so), add a name and description, and grab your short code.<br />
<br />
Locus will then use GPS to help navigate the user to the intended destination with a map and also driving instructions which update with the user's location, ideal if public transport is used.<br />
<br />
