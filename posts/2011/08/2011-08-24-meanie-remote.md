meanie remote - Smart Phone PC Remote Control<br />
<br />
One day I sat down on the sofa, and the remote was way over the other side of the room<br />
<br />
For those "lucky" enough to have a pc running their tv and media, the age old problem of remote control location is still an issue, but, one thing your never without is your smart phone<br />
<br />
So meanie was born, it has a mousepad, keyboard and number pad, along with the main buttons for Windows Media Center so it does more than your old remote anyway.
