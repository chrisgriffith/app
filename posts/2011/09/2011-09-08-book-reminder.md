Book Reminder is a fantastic solution for people who reads a lot of books and wants to keep track of books which they are willing to read, books which they have read or books they have purchased but still have not read them.
You can keep adding books and can mark them as Read or Purchased. Once you finish reading of book you can give them a rating also so that later you can find a book in your spare time to read it again.
