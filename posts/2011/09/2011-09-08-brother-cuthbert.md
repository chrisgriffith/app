- Should I go to the 9am church service or have a lie in and go to the 11am service?
- Should i bake the extra special cake for the Sunday service or just go with a victoria sponge?
- Will we get the funds for the church roof before the winter?

Brother Cuthbert can help you answer all these questions and many more with just the touch of a button.
