PropertyFinder is an experiment in creating Windows Phone 7 applications using JavaScript / HTML5. It uses a combination of the following technologies:<br />
<br />
jQuery - everyones favourite JavaScript library!<br />
<br />
PhoneGap - a cross-mobile framework which provides a mechanism for wrapping JavaScript applications up within a native wrapper.<br />
<br />
KnockoutJS - a JavaScript MVVM framework.
