This App was developed specially for the emergency medical service and for paramedics. It helps with translating in the prehospital stage. <br />
<br />
It translates in all major languages of the world and uses the anamnesis-system of «SAMPLE» and «OPQRST». There's also a dictionary with the most important adjectives, times, body parts and diseases. <br />
<br />
While using you can always switch between the phone's language and the foreign language, so the app can also be used by the patient. <br />
All translations have been made by or with native speakers and represent the common speech, so that all of your patients can understand.
<br /><br />
It can translate to:<br />
- French<br />
- German<br />
- Spanish<br />
- Arabic<br />
- Chinese<br />
- Japanese<br />
- Korean<br />
<br />
If there's a language or there are important words missing, I would be pleased to get feedback.
