Money Toolkit is a mobile banking and simple budgeting app where you can see all your UK bank accounts in one place on your iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch.<br />
<br />
You can quickly group your spending into different categories, see clearly what you have spent, and set targets for the month.<br />
<br />
Money Toolkit is read only, we can't transfer money. We have designed an incredibly tough innovative security system that keeps your details totally safe.
