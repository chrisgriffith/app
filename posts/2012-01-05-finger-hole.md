FingerHole is an exciting game that has made it to the App Store! Start the game and put your phone somewhere below your waist. The goal is to trick another person into looking at your screen. If the Victim looks at it, he has lost the game, and is subsequently hit on the arm.<br />
<br />
If the victim touches the picture without looking he or she wins the game, therefore getting to hit you in the arm.<br />
<br />
You can create a victims list and even post on your victim's Facebook wall!
