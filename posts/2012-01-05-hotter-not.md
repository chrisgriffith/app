Hotter Not is a game that allows you to vote on which of your Facebook friends is "hotter". Be sure to click "not", if a family member shows up!<br />

Privacy Notice: The only information it uses from Facebook is a list of your friends and their gender. It does not post anything on your wall and all of your votes/results will be kept secret so that only you can view them.
