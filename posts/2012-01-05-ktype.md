KType is an assistive communication app for individuals who cannot speak with ease or speed. It is built to assist users who find it difficult to control keyboard, mouse, or LCD. It accepts input via the touchscreen or bluetooth keyboard, speaks in natural male and female voices, and instantly guesses what the user is trying to type. It can be configured to assist individuals with muscle spasms, motor tics, and partial paralysis, as well as those who have trouble reading, writing, and spelling.
