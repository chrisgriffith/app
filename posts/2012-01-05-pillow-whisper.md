A beautiful, elegant and clean Twitter client. Designed for artistic users. Pillow Whisper is a proof-of-concept HTML5 app that combines the KISS (keep-it-simple-and-stupid) philosophy with modern UI design. We take UI design as seriously as high end expresso coffee.<br />
<br />
Besides basic functions such as viewing timeline and posting tweets, Pillow Whisper also comes with a full theming system. Version 1.0 bundles with three themes: Pillow Whisper, Tonight and Tomorrow. More themes are coming in next release!<br />

Pillow Whisper will be forever free. There will be no ads either. It's all about pure sensation.<br /><br />

Features:<br />

* Exclusively designed for artistic enthusiasts, with every UI artwork manually crafted<br />
* Modern HTML5 app for your tech vanguards, too<br />
* Unique UI design brings you unique experience<br />
* Powerful theming system<br />
* Viewing, posting, retweeting tweets<br />
* In future updates, more twitter functions will be added<br />
<br />
Go for it, grab it, enjoy it and tweet it -- enjoy the UI design as you would enjoy your espresso. That's the HTML5 way.
