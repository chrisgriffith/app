Bring the soothing sounds of wind chimes wherever you go.  Easy to use Mobile Chimes set a relaxing ambiance in any setting.  Simply choose a root note (the lowest note in the chime set), the number of chimes (1 to 10) and one of five scales, hang the chime and press play.<br />

Wind velocity can be set from a whisper of a breeze to high winds or use the GPS function on your phone to match the wind where you are at the touch of a button. Note: the geolocation feature has been tested only in the U.S.A
