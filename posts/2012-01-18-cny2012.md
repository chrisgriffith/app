For Celebrating 2012 Chinese New Year, WHY INTERACTIVE prepared a mini game turning all the traditional greetings become funny icons, wish you have fun in the year of Dragon*!<br />
<br />
*The game is designed for native cantonese speaker.<br />

Note: I am a designer based in Hong Kong, this is the first app I developed using Phonegap and I really love it!
