QR-Trophy is an app to promote the brand new 2013 Mercedes-Benz A-Class which will debut at Geneva Motor Show in March 2012.<br />
It is part of a competition to win a trip to the world premiere of the A-Class in Geneva. The app allows participation in the competition and the collection of "badges". These can be collected by scanning QR codes printed on prototype cars which can be found in print, in social media and on the street. <br />
(At the moment only in german)<br />
