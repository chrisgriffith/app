Haikus are the Japanese poetical form usually composed of a 5 syllable phrase, followed by a 7 syllable one, and finished with another 5 syllable phrase.<br />
This app randomly generates English-language haikus that are bizarre, humorous, and sometimes cynical, and can be tweeted or emailed to your friends.
