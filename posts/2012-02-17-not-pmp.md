Our tongue-in-cheek iPhone app supplements PMP training. It teaches you methods that we have observed on many projects ‐ methods that can cripple a project, demoralize the staff, and leave the project late and over budget.  If you just strive to do the opposite of what this app teaches you, you'll be a reasonably good project manager. You'll be appreciated by your team, but your managers may not appreciate you saving the client so much money. After all, the PM’s job is to spend the budget.
