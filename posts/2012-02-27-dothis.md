doThis may be the most minimalist to-do list app available. Keep it simple and keep your tasks together with doThis. You just enter your list, then doThis will only show you one item at a time. This way you can focus and you won't get overwhelmed. Note that a task is done, and it disappears from your list. If you don't have the time to complete a specific task, just skip and let the list cycle to the next item.
