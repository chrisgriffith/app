This is a simple but intuitive pair matching game. It is the perfect game for Kids and everyone who wants to train it's remembering capacity.<br />
<br />
All cards are painted by hand and are easy to remember. Especially kids will love them. Of course, the cards are optimized for the iPhone retina display!<br />
<br />
The rules are easy, and well known: match two cards with the same picture. You have to find all cards to finish the game.
