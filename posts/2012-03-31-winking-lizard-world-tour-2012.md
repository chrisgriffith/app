Unofficial application for the Winking Lizard World Tour 2012. It is now available on the Android Market and soon we hope to have this listed on the Apple market as well. It can easily be ported to other devices by request. There are also plans to release a limited free version. It was built with Sencha Touch and PhoneGap and does screen scrapping of the official Winking Lizard World Tour site. As we are both well into tour ourselves expect to see this application have frequent updates.
