Grace and Peace Magazine proudly enters phone app culture with the release of bobble head likenesses of John Wesley, Phineas Bresee, Uncle Buddy Robinson, and Mildred Bangs Wynkoop. Each likeness is poised to entertain<br />
and educate Nazarene clergy and laity. Apps for the bobble heads will allow users to hear audio of familiar quotes, sayings, or hymns. Short video interviews will explain each personâ€™s contribution to the Church of the Nazarene.
