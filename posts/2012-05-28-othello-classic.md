Othello is a 2 human players game.  

The object of the game is to have the majority of your color discs on the board at the end of the game  

Black always move first  

A move consists of "outflanking" your opponent's disc(s), then flipping the outflanked disc(s) to your color  

If a player can't place his disc, the game will automatically change the turn  

You can know the turn by the color of the background
