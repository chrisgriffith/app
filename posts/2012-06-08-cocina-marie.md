Cooked.it has launched its first iPad Application, Cocina Marie.  In Marie's kitchen you'll find fresh, simple, step-by-step recipes for every course and any occasion.  Plus, since Cocina Marie is on the Cooked It network, you'll be able to connect with friends to see what they are cooking and add your own photos and notes to the recipes.<br />
Applications built on the Cooked It network are built with PhoneGap for quick and easy development and distribution and are available in Apple's iTunes Store.
