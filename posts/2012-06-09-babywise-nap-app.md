The Babywise Nap App is an analysis tool that can help any parent isolate the underlying cause of nap disruptions and sleep disturbances for infants between 2 to 12 months of age. By working through a few basic questions, the App reduces the hundreds of nap disturbance variables down to the most likely causes for a baby's sleep disturbance. Once the list is generated, the app offers the most appropriate solution based on the analysis from the data provided.
