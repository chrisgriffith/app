clrpickr automatically generates colour palettes by averaging the colours within an image, either from the camera, or by picking a pre-existing image from your gallery.<br />
<br />
These colour palettes are then returned as either HEX or RGB colour values, which can be copied to your clipboard for convenience.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------<br />
This app uses html canvas to assess image data, and uses the clipboard plugin for the final output
