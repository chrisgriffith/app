Troopla is the first fan-powered sports reporting service.  It’s designed for any team and any sport.  It's perfect for high school and youth teams.  You can create a live scoreboard, share score-enhanced photos, and invite other fans to participate.  Troopla makes it easy to cross-post your updates to Facebook and Twitter.  You can access Troopla with the Android app or as a web app with any smartphone or computer.  So, when you can’t make the game in person, you can follow it on Troopla.
