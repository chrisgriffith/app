Footwork is a mobile political canvassing tool that replaces the traditional clipboard and paper and allows campaign managers intelligently plan routes for their canvassers that are displayed on the Footwork mobile application. The canvasser uses the app to track script data from the locations they visit that is then fed back to a management console. Footwork integrates with Facebook to allow canvassing efforts to be published to the canvassers timeline. Like a Run Keeper, but for canvassing.
