LetterBug is your child's digital guide to the alphabet! Each letter is introduced with a sound and picture, making real-world associations to all 26 letters of the alphabet. Designed from the ground up to minimize accidental input from little fingers, all the app's controls are placed at the top of the screen. With one touch, they are easily tucked away for even greater protection against unintended taps.
