The easyScan application, with its graphics and its ease of use, allows you to scan any QR code and decode it quickly.  

After the decoding phase easyScan will provide the best action related to the content, like opening Safari if the result is a web url, the phone app if it is a phone number, or the email client in the case of an email address.  

  

Phonegap let us to use a very quick and reliable barcode scanner platform and the coding done directly in HTML+JS quickened up the develop of the app.
