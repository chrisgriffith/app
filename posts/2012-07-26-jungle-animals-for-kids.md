Jungle Animals for iPad is collection of 4 mini games for young children to interact with.

Jungle Animals was originally created by me for my daughter, Zoe. The app wasdesigned to teach her the names of various animals but more importantly, help develop her fine motor skills in a fun and rewarding way.

Due to the positive results, I'm now sharing this app so other parents can benefit, too!
