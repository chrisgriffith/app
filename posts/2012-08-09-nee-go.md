nee-go is a “Share the Screen” multiplayer game only, created specifically for large screen tablets and can be played with 2 to 4 players.

nee-go can be played as fast or as slow as you want. Gameplay is based on the Japanese game ninuki-renju, a variant of renju or gomoku and the American game Pente. It is played on an 11 by 15 board to make games quick and tense.

Gameplay is simple. Be the first to get 5 blocks in a row or capture 5 sets of blocks from another player.
