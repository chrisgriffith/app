This application will through a series of quizzes enable you to test your knowledge of articles in German. There are over 700 nouns arranged into lessons of twelve, together with English translations. You begin with the most frequently used words that are repeated until you remember them together with the right article. The application intelligently compiles the subsequent lessons, ensuring that you reinforce the knowledge already obtained and gradually extend it to all the nouns included.
