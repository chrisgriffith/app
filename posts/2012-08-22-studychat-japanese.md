StudyChat Japanese is taking:
Learn Japanese language + flashcards + dating-sim style of game + gorgeous graphics + audio listening, all rolled into one.

This isn't just word-by-word flashcards, but coherent, uniquely-generated conversations each game. Each conversation focuses most on the Japanese kanji words that you have difficulty with most, learning and adapting to your skill as you go.

This app is for intermediate Japanese students to practice fluent Japanese conversation skills.
