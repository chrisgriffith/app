Completure allows users to listen to Police scanners in more than 15 countries and create mini-stories by capturing real-world events using camera, geolocation, and have the community vote and share them to derive the top ones. The final result is an app that shows you the top stories in any country of the world, created and voted by the users. 

"We wanted an open source technology to develop a robust application in a fast and efficient way with a small learning curve," said Mark Malkoun, co-founder of Completure. "We also needed the ability to change features easily so we knew that HTML5 was the way to go.  After we studied all the solutions out there we were amazed by the PhoneGap approach and its flexibility, especially the PhoneGap plugins and the community working on it. Phonegap is not only the best, but the only real solution to our problems."

Highlights include:

- Decentralized - Instead of having centrally-controlled media giants deciding what the public should or should not know about, Completure empowers users to share news.

- It's not like your typical followers-based social network. If an important event is happening in your area you will know about it without having to follow anyone who happens to be there.

- Data is accurate and noise-free in terms of location and time, as only 3-day old + geotagged photos are accepted.

- Create a story and publish in seconds. Take a series of pictures, write a few words and publish your story to shed a light on anything you want your community to know about.
