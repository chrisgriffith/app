MiTeam is an app to help coaches communicate with players and their families. Create a team for any sport. Publish practice and game schedules with integrated directions. Create a team roster, track team statistics, share team photos (and tag players). 

MiTeam is 100% free and always will be. We've built it in honor of my late brother-in-law, David Dimarco. Dave passed away in 2012 after a tough fight against Mesothelioma. View the story of Dave and MiTeam at http://vimeo.com/50398163
