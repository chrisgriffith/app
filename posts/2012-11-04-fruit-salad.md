Similar to the popular game Bejeweled, Fruit Salad is a fun puzzle-game that lets you flip adjacent fruits to create lines of 3 (or more). Gain more points by matching up more fruit and scoring combos.

"PhoneGap Build is a great tool for web developers who want to give App Store visibility to their HTML apps" said Fruit Salad creator, Baptiste Brunet.
