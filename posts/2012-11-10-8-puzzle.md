The 8-Puzzle is a tile based game, invented in 1874, where each tile can be moved horizontally or vertically subject to a constraint that the adjacent tile must be an empty tile. 
WHY SHOULD I DOWNLOAD THIS PARTICULAR 8-PUZZLE APP?
We only give you valid configurations to play with, when you Shuffle. Every Puzzle has a solution with the minimum moves. There is a Puzzle Solver, where you can create you own puzzle and see the solution in minimum moves!
