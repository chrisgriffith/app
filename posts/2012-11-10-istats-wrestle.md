iStats Wrestle is a powerful application that lets you manage and track statistics for a scholastic or collegiate wrestling team and sync stats between multiple iPads. Simply input your wrestlers, enter stats as a match happens, and the app does the rest. It will score every match, keep all matches chronologically ordered, organize matches into Events, and generate statistics for each wrestler on your team.
