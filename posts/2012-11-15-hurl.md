Hurl is the Social Video DJ app that transforms any TV screen into a video jukebox where users can hurl their favorite YouTube videos right from their smartphones! Using the Hurl smartphone app, viewers can interact with each other's videos during playback and hurl additional clips into a shared queue. Viewers can like or dislike videos and even “skip vote” clips, which stops playback and instantly launches the next video in the queue! Launch a screen now at www.hurl.net!
