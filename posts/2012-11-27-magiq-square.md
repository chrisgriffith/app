MagIQ Square is a game that makes it possible to solve thousand-year old puzzles on your 21st century phone. Those who like Wordfeud or Sudoku, are likely to love the MagIQ Square. Solving the MagIQ Square requires logic and strategic thinking while also providing a little bit of mental math workout. It is possible to compete against oneself, and challenge others, at different levels of difficulty.
