Presentation Timer Pro is a presentation timer that provides configurable color cues at different points in your presentation to help you stay on-pace.

Presentation Timer Pro supports presentations up to 100 hours in length. Checkpoints may be specified at arbitrary times throughout your presentation to help you to mark time. At each checkpoint, the timer may be changed to an arbitrary color of your choosing.
