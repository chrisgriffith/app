In the New Library of Alexandria,  amazing papyrus has been discovered, the Egyptians and the Mayans had a sort of calendar where both cultures were communicating through the stars. 

Apparently the end of the world, we all know, will not be in 2012, the Egyptians also had an advanced calendar, two years ahead of the ancient Maya one.
