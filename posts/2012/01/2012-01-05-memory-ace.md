Like the classic card game, Concentration, Memory Ace is played by tapping cards to flip them over and then remembering their locations to make pairs â€“ which fly off the page with a gentle whoosh or the squawk of a  bird. The highest scores are made by matching all the cards with the fewest flips.<br />
The game opens with a small set of cards to give the user a quick feel for the action. Options allow the addition of more cards and a selection of what to match: symbols, colors, flags, beetles, or famous art.
