A fun and interactive way for kids to learning spelling and reading words!<br />
TiichMe Words For Kids uses the Dolch sight words to help kids learn their reading and writing words. Your children will learn the most commonly used words for kindergarten through fourth grade, and are used in elementary schools across the US. We have combined a fun and interactive game with the audio and visual of each word for an engaging experience that helps your child retain what they've learned.
