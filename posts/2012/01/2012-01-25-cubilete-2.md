Have you ever play Cubilete before? Do you like playing dice games? Then try playing this very popular and traditional Cuban game of dice on your mobile device. <br />
<br />
You can play Cubilete against 3 other simulated players on the table following the classic rules. Throwing the Cubilete is easy; you can use the buttons on the screen or simply SHAKE your device, once the shaking movement stops the dices will roll.  Each player takes its turn to throw or roll the dices (configurable up to 3 rolls) setting aside any dice they want for their final hand. The player with the highest 5 of a kind hand wins (Aces are wild cards). A number of rounds are played and the winner of a game is the first to score the defined number of points (or patas).<br />
<br />
Also you can play Poker Dice using Cubilete. Similar to the Cubilete game, each player takes its turn to roll setting aside any dice they want for their final hand. At the end of the round, the player with the best hand wins.<br />
