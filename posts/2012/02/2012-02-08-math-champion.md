Math Champion is a must-have for parents with school-aged kids. It helps them master math skills in a fun way.<br />
<br />
Developed closely with a group of students, each course is designed specially to suit their learning habits. By observing how students learn, we carefully structure the course in such a way that students can build up their skills, confidence, interest, and speed in a systematic manner.<br />
<br />
The application has plenty of encouragement for students to learn math by themselves. Students are rewarded whenever they answer a question correctly. A trophy can be earned if they have been awarded a medal in each unit in a course.
