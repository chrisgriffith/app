TechDoc is a distributed system composed of two distinct applications: a central java based web application using a SQLite database to import Technical documentation from CSV files (catalogue + files) and an Android based app to install in a mobile phone, which is synchronized with the central web application and is able to work off-line and show the catalogue and files (e.g. PDF files).
