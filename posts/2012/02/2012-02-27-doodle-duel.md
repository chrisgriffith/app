Doodle Duel is a 2 player game for the iPad.<br />
<br />
The aim of the game is to guess what random object is being drawn before your opponent does. You will have six possible answers to select from. The winner is the first person to guess correctly.<br />
<br />
Doodle Duel knows how to draw over 50 illustrations, and each round they are drawn in different ways and at many angles, so it's never quite the same each time you play.<br />
<br />
A duel consists of a series of matches, the winner being the player with the most wins.
