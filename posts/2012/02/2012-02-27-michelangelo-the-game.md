Michelangelo: The Game is a puzzle game I made for iOS in HTML5 using PhoneGap.  I have just released it on the iTunes App Store and plan on creating an Android version of the game in the near future.  <br />
<br />
The game is a puzzle game themed around Michelangelo, the great renaissance artist.  It feature 27-levels each featuring a famous work by the artist.
