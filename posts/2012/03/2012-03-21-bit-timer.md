This app is designed for the no-frills, hard-core workout.  This is the first interval timer youâ€™ll see with a set up that is this fast and easy.  Your workout should be intense, not your workout set up. <br />
<br />
1. Super Simple Set up. <br />
Get to your workout in no time with a clean, simple, no-frills design.<br /><br />

2. Distinct tones that guide you through your workout. <br />
We chose clear, easy-to-distinguish tones for each portion of your workout.<br /><br />

3. Work out to music with out missing a beat. <br />
Music automatically fades, allowing you to hear interval tones.
<br /><br />
<strong>Features:</strong><br />
