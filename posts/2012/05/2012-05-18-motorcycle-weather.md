Is the weather good enough to ride your motorcycle?  

  

This is a simple app used to determine if the weather forecast is good enough to drive a motorcycle. If the weather is good the app will display a motorcycle icon signifying that today you should ride your motorcycle. If the weather is bad the app will display a car icon signifying that today you should drive your car.
