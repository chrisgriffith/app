Bugify is an issue tracking system for managing bugs and issues for your projects.<br />
This app accompanies a Bugify site. In order to use this app you MUST have a Bugify site setup. You can either download Bugify and host it yourself, or use our hosted service.<br />
<br />
This is a great way to see what's happening with your issues/bugs, and to make quick changes while you're out and about.<br />
<br />
Finally, a bug tracker with a mobile app!<br />
