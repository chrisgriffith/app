EZQuotation is a tool to simplify the computation of the unit price of a product or service given a specific quantity number. As a seller, you may want to know quickly how much the unit price will be when a customer changes the projected quantity. As a customer, you may want to realize what the new unit price would be when you request a different quantity from the provided quote from your supplier. EZQuotation comes in handy to help you recalculate the unit price accordingly with right decision.
