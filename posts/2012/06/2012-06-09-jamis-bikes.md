The Jamis Bikes app is a good example of how PhoneGap along with JQuery Mobile can create very elaborate native apps.  The Jamis Bikes app allows users to take photo via their phone's camera or library and upload them to the Jamis Family photo wall.  It also allows users to follow their favorite Jamis Teams/Athletes by consolidating their Facebook and twitter feeds into one easy place to read. Jamis riders also upload videos from their phones for their fans to see. PhoneGap was used heavily.
