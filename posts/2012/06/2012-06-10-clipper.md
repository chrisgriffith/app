Clipper automatically saves text from your device's clipboard, and allows you to switch between previously saved items so that they can then be pasted into other apps. You can also email clipboard items to yourself, and add new items.<br />

Save your email addresses and usernames here and you can easily switch them into your clipboard for filling in web forms.
