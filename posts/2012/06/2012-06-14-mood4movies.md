Ever struggle to find the right movie to watch? Help is at hand with Mood4Movies. Just tell the app your current mood, and it will make a recommendation based on a carefully curated list of 150 movies. There's something for everyone, with classics from Hitchcock, Scorsese and Godard, ranging through to cult curiosities and modern essentials.  

  

This is my first PhoneGap project and have loved working on it with XCode.  

  

I'm now planning further updates and an Android version.
