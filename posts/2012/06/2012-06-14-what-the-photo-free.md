Do you enjoy sharing photos and playing games with your friends?  Take turns racing the clock to guess the photo as the tiles disappear in this turn-based social game. The faster you answer, the more coins you win! <br />
<br />
Be goofy and let your creativity flow as you snap photos and transform them into games throughout your day.  Draw out your best imagination. <br />
<br />
What the Photo? is also available in a <a href="http://phonegap.com/app/what-the-photo/">premium ad-free version</a>.
<br /><br />
<em>"PhoneGap let us leverage our HTML5 development skills, while giving us the flexibility to integrate native code where it made sense.  Maintaining a single codebase for  iOS and Android development has allowed us to iterate quickly on both platforms."</em>
