NASA leads the nation on a great journey of discovery, seeking new knowledge and understanding of our planet Earth, our Sun and solar system, and the universe out to its farthest reaches and back to its earliest moments of existence.  This NASA Science application brings you the latest information from NASAâ€™s Science Missions, including the spacecraft, their instruments, the data, and what we are learning about the questions we seek to answer.
