A simple calculator which focuses on functions commonly used in software development. 

Please note: this is not meant to be the holy grail of calculators but rather fulfil the missing gap in my, and hopefully your, workflow. 

Calculator for Programmers was made to include the missing modulus function; and to provide simplicity that looks great. 

Features 
- simple 
- focuses on functions commonly used by developers 
- focus on usability, not hello kitty themes. 
- includes modulus, pi, sin, c
