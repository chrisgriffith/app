The System Administrator Excuse Generator is a great and funny way to come up with new and amusing system failures to tell clients or superiors.
Excuses are generated from a wide array of IT buzzwords, and combinations can be picked at random, or manually refined if need be.
A great tool for when on the move, SysBull allows you to:
- Copy excuse to clipboard
- Send excuse in SMS
- Send excuse in email
