ExV Selection is the application, developed by CAREL, to quickly and easily select the correct size of the electronic expansion valve, either for A/C or retail applications.
Starting from the data relevant to the working temperature and cooling/heating capacity, the application calculates the valve size suitable for the manufacturer needs.
The algorithm model that makes the calculations has been developed thanks to the CAREL yearly experience in several application fields.
