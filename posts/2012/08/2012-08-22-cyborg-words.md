Letter tiles are flying off the conveyor belt. Can you build words on the game board before the letter tiles are gone? Don't sweat it - you'll get plenty of chances to build lots of words and advance to the next level if you take advantage of Pause & Think, Recycle Letters and Show Next 5.

Available on Apple App Store, Google Play, Amazon Android App Store, Kindle Fire, and review pending (as of 21 August 2012) for Barnes & Noble NOOK.
