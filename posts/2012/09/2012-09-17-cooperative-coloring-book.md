Color with others, unlock animations and collect ':)'

Coloring book with cooperative mode safe for kids* (read more).

- I’m a software developer and a father of two kids. My goal was to provide the children with a safe opportunity to work together while coloring – that’s why it’s only possible to color the existing pictures and shapes as well as giving/collecting points. No registration needed, no need for sending text or other messages. -
