Meet Zak, a loveable and hilarious yak with a big heart who loves helping kids. Come along on his next hair-raising adventure - Zak's heading to Nepal to bring books to a village perched high in the Himalayan Mountains. The kids who live there can't wait to meet him.

With each download of this app, Room to Read puts three local language books into the hands of children in countries across the developing world!
