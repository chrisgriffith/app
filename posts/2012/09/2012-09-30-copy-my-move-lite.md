This is a fun and thought provoking game. The game play is simple and addictive.

Objective- Solve each puzzle by aligning the large and small orange circles on top of the green checkered finish in the least amount of moves.

How To Move- Swipe in the direction you want the large orange circle to move and the smaller orange circle will copy that move in the opposite direction. For example, if you move the large circle down, the small circle will move up, if there is nothing in the way.
