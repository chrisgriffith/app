This is my second try to make PhoneGap app.
Now it's a game. It works with ipad and iphone4 and iphone5 screen resolutions.
Here I also used native plugins: AdMob, GameCenter, LowLatencyAudio.

Mamazzle is a simple puzzle game. And it's free!
Here you have to swipe only one word on the 6x6 field.
After you colorize all letters on the field level done.
