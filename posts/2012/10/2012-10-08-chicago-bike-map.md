The Chicago Offline Bike map is the best way to navigate Chicagoâ€™s vast network of bikeways. The entire app is stored on your iOS device, which allows you to browse freely with or without a network connection. You can design your own route or just discover new ways to get from A to B on streets with bike lanes or on trails.
