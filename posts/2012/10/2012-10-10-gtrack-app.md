GTrack is a simple application that shows you where you are and where you were. All the proceeds from the application, will be donated to the children of the ALYN hospital. As a cross-platform, mobile application developer, I decided to do something new. Therefore, in addition to raising funds by traditional methods, I decided to create and sell a mobile application. The ALYN Hospital is Israelâ€™s only Pediatric and Adolescent Rehabilitation Center and a world leader in this area.
