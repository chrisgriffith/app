This app helps a user learn about Irritable Bowel Syndrome, track their symptoms in a diary, track diet and activity, and view your results in a concise graph to help you assess what improves your symptoms. You can also share your results with your GP.

Developed in partnership with the national charity for IBS (the IBS Network) this is a first-of-its-kind app for the UK that empowers IBS sufferers to help them better manage their long term condition.

We are releasing to Android soon!
