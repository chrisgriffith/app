This calendar app allows you to enjoy beautiful photographs of World Heritage sites while learning interesting trivia about culture and nature related to the sites. Developed for Panasonic and UNESCO for the 2012 World Heritage Calendar release, it was picked up by Apple Japan as 'New and Noteworthy' and ranked 2nd 'Top Free Apps' in Japan.

FEATURES
* In landscape mode, the app displays today’s date like an ordinary desk calendar.
* In portrait mode, the app displays today’s date along with the time.
* Set as a slideshow, the photographs randomly changes every 60 seconds.
* Display your favorite photograph with the Quick Navigation button.
* Switch languages to select from Japanese, Chinese, English, French, and Spanish.
* Display trivia related to the Heritage Site on screen by tapping the detail button.

Looking to quickly develop and release for two platforms, PhoneGap was a natural choice to bring Panasonic’s calendar to a mobile audience.  As [BluSoft Inc's](http://blu-soft.com/) Alexander Wilhelm notes, “Not only could we go from prototyping to release in record time but maintenance time for future releases was also reduced because of the shared codebase.”
