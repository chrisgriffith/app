Color Accent lets you add accent / splash effect to your photos in seconds. It does all the work for you. Just pick a photo; Tap on a color that you want to keep and ... Boom ... Color Accent keeps your accent colors and makes everything else in your photo Black & White. You can select multiple accent colors by tapping the plus icon. You can also tap and hold to bring up a magnifier to pick an accent color.
