MeatText allows you to quickly tell someone where to meet you via text message. The best part is, the other person does not need this app to see the location! The location will open in their native mapping app and place a pin in the exact location you want to meet them. Not sure if your recipient has an iPhone? Don't worry the map will open on all devices- even a computer!

Meattext is more accurate than other apps because it sends text tied to latitude and longitude.
