Select a song from the album and it will begin playing, but if your phone stays still, it soon stops. Keep moving though, and the song will continue. The idea is to keep you dancing right through the album. Of course you could just keep shaking your phone, but that’s not as much fun, is it? As a bonus, if you take a photo of the album’s cover from within the app, image recognition will unlock remixes.
