'Socks for Knox' is a cute little app to entertain your little ones. Your 1-3 year old can tap or swipe different outfits to make tons of combinations. You can also add a message/caption and save the image to your camera roll (so you can email your mom or dad). More outfits will be added regularly to keep this interesting and entertaining for everyone.
