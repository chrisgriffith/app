This is a simple app for these who is as confused as me about the conjugation of french verbs. With a single button click, it displays all different forms of a french verb, such as, Present, Present Perfect, Simple Past, Past Perfect, Imperfect, Pluperfect, Future, Past Future and so on.
I wrote this app while struggling in an intensive french program. Hope it will ease the pain of studying French.
