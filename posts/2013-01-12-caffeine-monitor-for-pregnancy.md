This app is for pregnant women to decide what to eat/drink during pregnancy, caffeine wise, and share to a blog/friends. Can I treat myself to a latte or cappuccino? Which individual drinks or sizes are off limits?  Most major brands' drinks from the United States, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Austria, and China, updated quarterly or add your own.  Completely offline, fast usage, plain text timeless logging by time, and good for phones and tablets.
