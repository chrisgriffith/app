DigiGraff is a new social networking app that allows you to create images and spray them as virtual graffiti in your surroundings. Sketching images is done by drawing on the device screen. The phone can then be used as a pointer to determine where the sketch is going to be located. With the click of a button, the image is saved and can be found on the map at the specified location until it fades away. Also, the program includes other features such as likes, comments, user profiles and much more.
