FinderCodes combines confidential QR code tags, intuitive software, and cloud-based tracking to facilitate quick returns of your lost items! Simply attach FinderCode tags to your valuables and log them in your private FinderCodes inventory. If you lose an item a finder with an internet connection can scan the FinderCode tag with a Smartphone. You are automatically alerted that your item has been found and scanned. The finder can then arrange for the return either by SMS, email, or by phone.
