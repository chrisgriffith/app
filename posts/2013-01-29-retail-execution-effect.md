Mobility Effect’s Retail Execution Effect app allows consumer goods companies to optimize their retail execution efforts by placing easy-to-use resources at the fingertips of their merchandisers and sales reps. Gone are the days of a clunky handheld computer or unwieldy binder sitting on the front seat of a rep’s car while they’re in the store. Welcome to the next generation of Retail Execution.
