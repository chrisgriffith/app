A set of 4 machines designed to cryptographically encode or decode a message or an image inside another (carrier) image.  This is called "Steganography".  The app interface exhibits many interesting native-like touches and is a rich immersive experience for its users.  Built on top of Phonegap, utilizing our own Uni framework (http://www.bluejava.com/uni.html) for native effects.
