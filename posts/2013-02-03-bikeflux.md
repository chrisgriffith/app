BikeFlux is a cycling navigation application that allows you to navigate to wherever you want in a cycling friendly way. Your route is shown on the map and you can see your speed and location while cycling.

While you are cycling, BikeFlux is registering the distance you've cycled, your top and average speed. Afterwards this data will be sent automatically to the BikeFlux website.

You can also watch the total distance you have cycled on your profile page.
