Is a software tool for the smartphone, with which you can automatically record time sheets, to do payroll processing, and calculate the payments to employees, resulting in the payment vouchers that can be sent by email or excel file format, anywhere, anytime.

Contractor Payroll allows you to use your smart phone to capture (scan) the time of entry and exit of the employees, using two-dimensional bar codes (QR) printed on identification documents.
