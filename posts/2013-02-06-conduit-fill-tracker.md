Set to 2011 NEC code, Conduit Fill Tracker is a conduit fill calculator that finds allowable fill rates and keeps track of any combination of conductors as you switch between raceway types and sizes. Rather than reading lengthy conduit fill charts, use the easy-to-read graph to see current and remaining fill percentages and get alerts when you go over the allowable fill rate. Easily determine the maximum number of conductors you can use in your raceway, conduit or tubing.
