Twist is the easiest and most accurate way to let people know when you’re going to arrive. Whether you’re meeting up with friends, or running late to an urgent business appointment, Twist makes life easier by eliminating the stress and headaches caused by uncertain wait times and travel delays.

Twist’s innovative scheduling system accounts for traffic, different modes of transportation and your own habits when estimating your arrival time. Never again will you have to guess when you are going to arrive! Running late? Twist can automatically send an update to your pre-determined contacts to let them know your current location and ETA in real-time.

"By using PhoneGap, we cut our development time down considerably and have released to rave reviews on the Google Play store," said Lindsey Simon, Front End Developer at Twist. "Usage and downloads are going up and the underlying PhoneGap platform continues to improve and innovate."
