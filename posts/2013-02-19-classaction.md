Connect with fellow university students and easily find nearby study partners. ClassAction allows you to build a list of your current classes, and then uses location services to find nearby students currently studying for the same classes. Turn on ClassAction while at the library or union, and see if someone nearby is interested in studying together. Easily start an anonymous chat with any user that matches your class criteria!
