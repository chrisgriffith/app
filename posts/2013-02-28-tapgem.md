Meet TapGem, the grandchild of Rubik's cube, Minesweeper, Bejeweled and Sudoku. 

The object is simple: place gems on a board with 64 tiles and 8 colors so that the number of gems in each column and row match the numbers on the top and side of the board.
 
TapGem presents you with 60 puzzles of varying difficulty, providing hours of fun, challenge, and addiction. As you progress to the harder levels, don't be surprised if you start pulling out your hair.
