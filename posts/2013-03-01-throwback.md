Send your photos to the future!

ThrowBack is an iPhone photography app that captures a photograph but does not save it to your phone. Instead the photo is thrown into the future and emailed back to you and those you share it with at a random time, anywhere from 1 month to 5 years from the date the photo was taken.

In an era where our photographs are overexposed on countless sharing platforms, Throwback provides a unique opportunity to forget your memories so they can be remembered again.
