blogWalker connects to your tumblr.com account, and lets you view, reblog, like, and share posts from tumblr. The biggest benefit of blogWalker is being able to sort tags and blogs into smaller, more related categories, and just view the types of posts you’re interested in.  You can use blogWalker to view specific blogs, tags, categories you’ve created, or your dashboard. There is also a random mode and pre-made categories if you can’t decide what you want to see. Named Peek-A-Dash on webOS.
