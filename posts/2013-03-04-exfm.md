Exfm is a social music discovery platform powered by thousands of music sites across the web. An endless feed of great music lives at Exfm. The Exfm iPhone app features 'Smart Shuffle' which learns and adapts to users' listening habits. Users can see what their friends are listening to in real-time and look for songs, sites and other people with blazing fast autocomplete search.
