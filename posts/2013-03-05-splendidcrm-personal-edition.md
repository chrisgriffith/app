SplendidCRM Personal Edition is an implementation of SplendidCRM for personal use on a tablet device.  The product has the same look-and-feel as the SplendidCRM Community Edition web application, but it maintains a local database for single-user utilization.  Core modules include Accounts, Contacts, Opportunities and Leads.
