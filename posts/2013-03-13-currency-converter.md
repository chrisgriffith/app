Currency converter is a simple application that helps you convert from a currency to another. You can update the exchange rates everytime you want so you'll have always an up-to-date conversion. Once retrieved, the rates are saved so the user can use the application offline. Currently the app supports the following languages: English, Italian, French and Spanish.
