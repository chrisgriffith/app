Cloze is a free app that helps you keep track of all of the people that are important to you. Speed through email and catch up on Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter in one noise-cancelling inbox. 

Cloze brings together all of your relationships from email and social into a single view. It learns who is important to you and puts them up front, filtering out the noise of everything else.
