Lots of stores, including convenience stores or gas stations, have "2 For" deals where you can get 2 items for some dollar amount, for example 2 for $3.
Stores will have new 2For deals every month and then they go away at the end of the month or even the following month. How do you keep track? This app will help you locate those deals closest to you and enter new ones that you find.
This is a user driven application and is based solely on deals that are entered by you and others.
