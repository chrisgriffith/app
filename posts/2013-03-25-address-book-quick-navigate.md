Address Book allows you to quickly navigate to a stored address! You can import your contact addresses and names into Address Book from your contacts and quickly pull up navigation by tapping the address. Address Book can be password protected and there are multiple sorting options.

My intent for Address Book was to create an app that, after opening, it only takes one tap to pull up navigation.
