This tracker app allows you to track and store your blood glucose readings, set reminders to check, notify someone that you checked, and reports showing past entries.

Your entries are stored on your mobile device. They can be shared with someone who care about you via SMS text message automatically when you enter them. Reminders popup at a specified time everyday to remind you to check your blood sugar. Tap on the reminder and it will take you straight to the app.
