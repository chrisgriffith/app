SecurePhone is a security system that protects smart phones and tables when the device is not in your immediate possession and not secure. It detects when your device is lifted or moved or disconnected from power. It sounds an audio alarm, and a distress email is sent every 15 seconds until the device is disarmed. The email includes device identification and description, owner contact information, GPS location and a map.  Once armed, the phone is encumbered until disarmed with a 4-digit PIN.
