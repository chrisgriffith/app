More Sleep for You and Your Toddler
As parents of young children, we hear this question all the time. “Is it time to get up yet?” In fact, we hear it in our sleep, often because the child is waking us up at 5am to ask.

Now They Don’t Have to Ask
Finally, there’s an app to answer that question for your child. They go back to sleep—or at least, stay in their room—and you stay in bed. SleepSleep is great for nap time, or any time you need your child to continue doing short activities.
