The app allows you to discover and learn about outdoor places and get tips from other people. It offers a fun and simple way to share photos and posts live while you are on trail.
Best of all, LiveTrails helps you to navigate effectively. Take photos and you will get turn-by-turn directions to their locations. Use photos taken by other people to discover new interesting spots. It works like social breadcrumbs.
