Oxford & Cambridge Boat Race sponsors, BNY Mellon wanted to craft a hands-on app that gave race-goers the chance to feel the thrill and adrenaline of the contest, from the stern of the boat. UK-based open source experts, Inviqa selected PhoneGap software to fulfill the brief. The app involves turning your phone into an oar and rowing your way to victory. The mechanism of flipping your phone width ways to intuitively mirror the movements of an oar was technically challenging but very successful.
