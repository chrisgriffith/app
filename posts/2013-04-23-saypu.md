The Spell As You Pronounce Universal alphabet (SaypU, pronounced Sipe-You) is a simple practical phonetic alphabet that is used to speak and pronounce words in over 30 languages.

The App enables you to convert text written in foreign languages into SaypU spelling, whether the foreign language uses non-Roman characters (e.g. Arabic word ‘كلمة’ would be ‘kalima’) or Roman script (e.g. French word ‘chat’, which means ‘cat’ in English, becomes ‘sha’ in SaypU).
