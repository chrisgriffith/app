Goolor is the perfect tool for Designers and Developers. Goolor is a simple tool that helps web designers and developers to find variations of any color from a hex taken at random from the box or typed in the input field. In essence, it is a simple tool that helps you find lighter and darker colors based on any color. Then, just click generates gradient and the hex code is automatically created with 32 colors, starting and ending from white to black. Goolor is fun, simple, and a huge time saver.
