"My Childs Words" is a beginners spelling app for kids which allows the parent to enter any word they want their child to learn.
* Each letter is displayed one-by-one.
* Each letter is spoken out loud.

When you first install the app, the parent sets their own "PIN" which allows them to set or change the word. This prevents your child from accidentally changing the word.
Each time the big green GO button is pressed, the next letter of the word is displayed and spoken.
