The Seven Wonders of the World (or the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World) refers to remarkable constructions of classical antiquity listed by various authors in guidebooks popular among the ancient Hellenic tourists, in particular. The original list inspired innumerable versions for the ages, often listing seven entries. Of the original Seven Wonders, only one, the Great Pyramid of Giza, still stands.
