Monitor Google Apps domain activity on the go with Spanning Audit Log for Google Apps

In Google Apps environments with multiple admins or super admins, sometimes it can be difficult to keep track of what changes were made to the domain, who made them, and when. Audit Log for Google Apps not only allows admins to investigate changes in the past, but allows them to easily monitor these changes in real-time with push notifications.
