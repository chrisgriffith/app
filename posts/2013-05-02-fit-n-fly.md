The COBRA Golf Fit N Fly app is part calculator, part education tool. Although all the clubs, their features and benefits from COBRA's 2013 line are showcased, the true value of the FIt N Fly app lies in the three calculators - Driver Fitting, Long Game Gap Fitting and Iron Fitting. By answering some simple questions, the app can recommend options for virtually every club in your bag, including MyFly settings (COBRA's proprietary loft adjustability technology).
