The application is a nice game, a remake of the classic Find it!, But more exciting, innovative and in 3D.
Each level is represented by two twin rooms, on the walls of which are 5 differences. The player has to move between one room and another, looking for differences on the walls.
The controls are very simple: swiping your finger across the screen you change the wall; clicking on the door to change the room; by double-clicking on the area where there is a difference, you turn on the error.
