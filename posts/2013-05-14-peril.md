Peril is an elegant yet powerful distress notification tool. Specify one or more contacts, then set your timer. If you don't cancel the timer before it expires, an email is sent to your contacts with your distress message and last known coordinates. If you cancel the timer, nothing is sent to anyone.

Peril is cloud-based, which means that even if your phone is lost, stolen, confiscated or destroyed after you've set your timer, your designated contacts will still be notified.
