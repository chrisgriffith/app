Calculation for Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC).
Check how drunk you are. Alcohol Level Calculator will show you your actual Blood Alcohol Concentration in per mille and tells you, when you're sober again.
Kept simple with sliders so you can work with it even if you are already drunk.
The calculation is done by gender, age, height and weight. This data is stored in your profile and only needs to be entered once.
