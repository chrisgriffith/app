One of the best brain solver puzzle packs in a long time. Its fun, but still hard at the same time.

How far can you get into the Forrest of Poo. You have to unlock the first level pack to get to the hard levels. No inapp sales, only pure brain power can help you..!

You have to help Poonie Poo through the Forrest of Poonyland. The concept is simple, yet tricky. Collect all poo's in a level to complete it.
