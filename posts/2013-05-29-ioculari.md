Oculari is a "calculator" for all fans of astronomy that I developed as a hobby and leisure. Inputting a few data, as well as enabling you to check the quality of the configuration of your telescope, will also provide useful and practical tips for choosing the perfect eyepice, in a simple and understandable way. 
It also provides several parameters on the performance of your equipment.
