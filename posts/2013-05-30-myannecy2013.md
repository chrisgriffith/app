In 2013, the Annecy Festival and Mifa are proposing a mobile phone app to prepare, organise and live a connected experience! 
Be informed at all times about news, the programme (screenings, conferences, Mifa) and find your bearings once here to save time using geolocalisation. 
Mifa professionals can also take advantage of a connected space reserved just for you, to access the directory of attendees and the video library and organise your schedule of events and appointments.
