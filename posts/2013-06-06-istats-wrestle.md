iStats Wrestle brings wrestling stats into the 21st century. This app allows you to record matches as they happen, then create custom reports, show a wrestler's strengths and weaknesses, and have everything backed up to our secure servers.

Last fall, over 200 schools, universities, and freestyle groups made the move to iStats Wrestle, our innovative wrestling stats app for iPad and iPad Mini. This coming fall, we're expanding to Android and iPhone.
