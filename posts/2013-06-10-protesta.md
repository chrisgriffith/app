Do you want to help to change the world? 

That's the idea of this social platform. We want to know everything that can get better, and believe, it's really everything: political attitudes, expensive prices, traffic, bad services, holes.
You don't need to be formal neither wordy, just a few words to summarize your indignation. We want to end with the typical "i complain later" that everyone knows that ends up being forgotten.

Let's stop postponing our complaints and make things change?
