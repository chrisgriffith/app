To Do List Task Manager is a more detailed task manager application for the Android platform.  Built tasks along with the steps required for completion.  This allows you to add more in depth information to the tasks you need to complete.  View active tasks or completed tasks, delete tasks in either view, complete tasks by checking off each step or complete the entire task at once.  We think you're going to like this new take on an old idea.  Download it today.
