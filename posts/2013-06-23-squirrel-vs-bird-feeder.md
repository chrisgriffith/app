Anyone who has a bird feeder knows that squirrels can be very persistent in emptying the bird seed for themselves. In this game, you are the squirrel facing 10 logic challenges. Race against the clock as a cardinal keeps visiting the feeder and eating the seed before you do. At first, the bird feeder is accessible from a picnic table, but as the levels increase, you can tell the homeowner has resorted to desperate measures to protect the bird seed. For ages 5 and up.
