"The culture of "Deco" (photo-decoration) is a big part of Japanese youth culture. With that in mind, we decided to create a photo editing app witha simple heart theme. We added an auto-decoration function that is amazing and heart warming to this app," said Ryo Kawanobe, creator of My Heart Camera. "As we are web developers, we choose PhoneGap because we wanted the flexibility to release on both iOS and Android while also being able to easily access plugins."
