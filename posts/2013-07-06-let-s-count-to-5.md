Young children are encouraged to learn to count up to five by exploring a beautifully designed and interactive garden environment.
The application offers a unique reading experience, where the original hand-drawn illustrations by Roberta Pagnoni, a leading contemporary childrenâ€™s book illustrator, are brought to life through engaging animations.
