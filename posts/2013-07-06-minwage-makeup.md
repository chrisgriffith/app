MinWage Makeup helps tipped employees determine if they are making at least minimum wage, after tips, and if not, how much their employer may be liable for to supplement their pay, also known as "minimum wage make-up".

Some States require that a tipped worker is paid at least minimum wage before tips are taken into account.

If you are a server, bartender, etc., you may not be getting all the pay owed you.

Since each State has different laws, a minimum wage make-up calculator is needed.
