Obacht is a new multiplayer game for smartphones. It was created by a project team at the Augsburg University of Applied Sciences.
Two on-screen players each run on their own planet. This is where the fun starts! 
Take care of your "Hogi" and try to avoid running into obstacles. Even better - you can place traps in the way of your enemy's "Hogi" to make life difficult for him. 
So be prepared to put your reflexes to the test!
