In this Math App, there are no words to explain except at index. So let me introduce the concept of this app, Math Bridge. An Orbit of thrown object as quadratic curve can be a bridge connected between the real world and math. Math is a tool as well as a world. The difference of the real world and a world is ambiguous, because we can't see the real world without a world, which is our own world.
