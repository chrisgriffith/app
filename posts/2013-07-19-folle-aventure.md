The Tourist Office of Saint-Jean-De-Monts presents their new application "Folle Aventure" (Crazy Adventure). This experience allows users to explore and learn about the famous tourist resort thanks to 13 points of interest, distributed in the seaside resort, with for each several missions as audio quiz, image shaker, multiple choice... By completing the objectives, tourists collect points which are accumulated to win different small gifts and share images and postcards on Facebook and by mail.
