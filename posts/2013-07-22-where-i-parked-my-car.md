An application that lets you bookmark where you parked your car, and then find a route to return to it. This application is useful if you don't have a good memory or if you're in a foreign city. In addition, "Where I parked my car" will also save a log of your saved positions (up to 50), so that you can retrieve a location for future use. The list allows you to see the position on a map, and you can also to delete one or more old locations.
