Are you a fan of Salman Khan or Shahrukh khan.
See how they patched up their differences on the holy iftar party
Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan, have ended one of the film industry's most-talked-about feuds
Both the actors hugged each other at an Iftar party hosted by Congress leader and Bandra MLA Baba Siddique in Mumbai on Sunday. They had not spoken to each other after a fight at actor Katrina Kaif's birthday party in 2008.
