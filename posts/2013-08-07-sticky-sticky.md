I would like to tell you about my new game: Sticky Sticky, a 2d platform game. Is it available on web browsers and on the OUYA console. The OUYA version features 2 players arenas. The game is made of  html + jQuery + Phonegap plugins for sound & gamepad controls. 

Take a look at the game trailer:
