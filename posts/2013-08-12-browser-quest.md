BrowserQuest is a small multiplayer game inviting you to explore a world of adventure from your Windows Phone.

You play as a young warrior driven by the thrill of adventure. No princess to save here, just a dangerous world filled with treasures to discover. As you discover more of the world, you can try to complete the built in quests/achievements or fight against other players.

So what are you waiting for? Download the game right now and start your journey into the unknown and mysterious world. 

Note: This version of BrowserQuest is a extended version, which has been extended with a player level system and PvP fights, so the game feels a little bit longer.

Support: If you experience any errors, then please contact us by e-mail (apps@mpbrun.dk), as we cannot contact you through a review. We can then fix possible errors very quickly.
