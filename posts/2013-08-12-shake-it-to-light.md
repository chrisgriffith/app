It's a simple flash light app that you can shake your phone and it will come to light even when you put on the background by pressing your home button.

It can be used as a mean of SOS light signal by pressing the Help On button.
To turn it off just shake it again.

Alternatively you can turnoff the shake detection and you can just manually press the Light button on and off.
