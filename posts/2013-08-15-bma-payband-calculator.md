The pay banding system, for Junior Doctors, has been in operation in the United Kingdom since 2000. It is different for those who are in fullâ€“time training and those who are flexible trainees. Depending on the average number of hours worked, the amount of the time at work actually spent working, and the overall pattern of the hours, Junior Doctors are banded and receive a supplement, based on their band. Our calculator allows Junior Doctors to work out the banding for their post.
