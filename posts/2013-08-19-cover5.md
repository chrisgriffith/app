The Sports Game Where Every Point Matters
Every point of every game matters with the Cover5 scoring system. We use the Cover5 spread to strike a balance between the favorite and the underdog. Points are scored based on how much each pick covers or doesn't cover the spread.
Cover5 uses real teams and real scores so you won't have to root for players on teams you hate or blow your season because your first round draft pick tore an ACL. The Cover5 mobile app allows you to play anywhere, anytime!
