Train your ear to recognize notes and chords with Pitch!

Pitch! will play a note or a chord. Then it is up to you to decide which note/chord was played. Type in your answer on the piano keyboard and Pitch! will tell you whether you are right or wrong.

Collect points and achieve a new highscore. Compare yourself to other Pitch!-Players.

* 12 single notes (C4 range)
* 24 chords (C3-C4 range)

You can set Pitch to play single notes, chords or both at random.
