Celebrate Rosh Hashana, the Jewish new year, by blowing the shofar to wake up toys, animals and parents in this interactive story full of surprises. Children and parents will delight in actually blowing into their devices to sound the shofar and bring the story to life in colorful animations created by best-selling illustrator Laura Huliska-Beith with narration by Randi Zuckerberg and a rollicking soundtrack.
