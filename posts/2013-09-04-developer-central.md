Developer Central allows you to watch YouTube videos about programming, technologies, design, 3d and much more.

It uses the YouTube Data API and it was developed in HTML5, AngularJS and Phonegap 3.0 in order to work on every HTML5 browser (as web app) and to be available on different marketplaces (as native app).

CSS and responsive layout techniques have been used to support desktop, tablet and smartphones resolutions.
