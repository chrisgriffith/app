Sending SMS with substitution of sender
Spoofy helps you send text messages from other numbers. EX: you just have to write telephone number, but your friend will see contact name(as he/she saved in his contact list)
1) write a message 
2) write your friend's number
3) and then write the sender's number whatever you want(phone number or some word)
You'll get 3 credits to have a try. Support for SMS delivery to over 600 operators in 170 countries. Spoofy doesn't work in USA, Canada and India.
