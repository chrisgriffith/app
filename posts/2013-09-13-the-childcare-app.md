The ChildCare App is an app made for helping parents in Singapore to find the best child care centers. It collected 2000 over detailed child care center information including exact location, nearby transport and estimated price/programme list. It is designed to help parents to socialize with each other, share their child care center experience and follow topics they care about such as government policies and child care product sales.
