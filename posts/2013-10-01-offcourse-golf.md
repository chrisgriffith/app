OffCourse is your whole golf experience on your smart phone. While other golf apps try to be a caddy in your pocket, OffCourse is more like a golf pro. OffCourse not only keeps your score while you play, it also keeps track of important stats like accuracy and number of putts; you get an in depth statistical picture of your game so you can make progress and live the golf dream... lower your score and have more fun.
