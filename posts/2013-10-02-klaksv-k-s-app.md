Welcome to The Northern IslandsThe "Northern Isles" is a term used to describe the six islands of Fugloy, Svínoy, Viðoy, Borðoy, Kunoy and Kalsoy, which makes up the north eastern corner of the Faroe Islands. 

These six islands are very different and each has its own distinctive character. Together they make up a unit around the main town of Klaksvík. Here you will find a dramatic countryside, idyllic villages and a people who live in close connection with the beautiful, yet dangerous ocean.
