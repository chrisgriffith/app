Fitwatchr integrates with Fitbit activity tracker devices, allowing users to visualize their Fitbit activity in new and exciting ways.  Currently, the app retrieves daily Fitbit device activity minutes and breaks the activity down to 3 levels of intensity. Users can import this info into other health-focused apps and popular weight loss programs to learn more about their exercise routines.
