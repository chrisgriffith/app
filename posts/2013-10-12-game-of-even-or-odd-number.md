The Game of even or odd number is very fun to play. There is a collection of numbers placed side by side. When you drag and drop one number on top of the other, the selected mathematical operation will occur and if you selected the correct numbers, you will get points. Every time you play and your points are higher than the previous time you have played, you move to the next level of the game. There are 30 levels for every game type. Internet connection is required in order to play the game.
