National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, or NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a tool used by healthcare providers to objectively quantify the impairment caused by a stroke.

This app provides an interactive NIHSS form that automatically calculates the score.

We believe that the best tools are the ones that you have with you. So, by bringing golden standard tools, such as the NIHSS, we aim to make evidence based examinations more accessible.
