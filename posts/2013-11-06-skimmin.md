Skimmin is a news summary service. Our goal is to inform users of the most important information in 1 minute a day. We accomplish this by hand-selecting about 10 news stories each day; stories we felt the 'average' American should have heard. These select few stories are then presented to you as concise, 325-character summaries, not lengthy articles.
