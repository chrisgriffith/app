Drag the dots is a simple matching game, drag the current dot onto its twin, then the next dot onto its twin until none are left. It's you versus the clock, versus yourself, versus the world!

Compete with a global and local scoreboard in this colourful and addictive micro game. Each round can be less than 20 seconds, ideal for those on the move!
