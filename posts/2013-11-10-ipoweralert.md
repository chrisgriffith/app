Power alert: you are out of home/office and want to be notified (sms message) if there are AC power failure?

What happens in your home or in your office if there is a black out in your absence?
If you run out of electricity(current power interruptions), iPowerAlert  will alert up to 3 cellphone numbers (via text message, SMS) of the problem, warning also, eventually, if the electricity supply is restored.
Do not leave your house alone when you can have a "Power Tutor"!
