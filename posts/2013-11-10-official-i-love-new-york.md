Funny Garbage collaborated with Empire State Development and AT&T to create the I Love NY app, targeted for residents and tourists planning to explore New York state.

This app is powered by New York Stateâ€™s Open Data platform, pulling information from a robust and ever expanding database of information about the places and events across the state.
