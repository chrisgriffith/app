The Qualia App was developed to support cultural organisations improve audience evaluation and feedback in order to better understand impact. This version was tailored specifically for the Cheltenham Literature Festival for October 2013. As this is now past the schedules and feedback sections will not function.

Qualia App was produced through a partnership of Cheltenham Festivals, i-DAT at Plymouth University and evaluation and impact researchers from The University of Warwick.
