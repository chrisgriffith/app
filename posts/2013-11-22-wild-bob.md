Hi there,
I am pleased and excited to introduce to you a tool that I think would come in handy for every outdoorsman. Whether your passion is Hiking, Mountain Climbing, Boating, Kayaking, Fishing or just head to the wilderness to relax from the busy hectic life of the big city, I think and hope you will find Wild Bob App a nice companion for you to aid you while you are in the wild. 
Wild Bob! App can do all of the following for you:
Give you your GPS coordinates and Altitude. Calculate the linear distance between your current location and any GPS coordinates you may be heading for.
1.	A detailed weather forecast to keep you abreast of the weather changes in your area to help you plan a good outing and a safe comeback.
2.	A detailed Marine weather forecast with water temperature, air temp, swelling information, wind directions and more.
3.	A compass to help you find your way in the wild.
4.	A Map of your current location with all the surrounding landmarks with the ability to zoom in or out to your liking.
5.	All units are provided in both the British and Metric System to help outdoorsmen from different background get the data they want the way itâ€™s most useful to them.
Wish you great vacations and thanks for reading.
