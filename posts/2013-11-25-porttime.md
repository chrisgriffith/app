California-based PortTime is a startup dedicated to making the lives of those working within the Port Of Oakland easier. We helped them bring their flagship product, PortTime, to life. PortTime not only taps into user-sourced contributions to calculate terminal wait times, but also provides a rich communication platform with real-time news, commenting, group messaging and more.
