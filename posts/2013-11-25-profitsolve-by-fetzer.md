Greygoo specializes in helping both start-ups and established brands conceive, build, launch and market successful digital products. We brought these skills to the table when Fetzer, the Earth Friendly Winery, approached us to create ProfitSolve, a mobile app that provides retailers and restauranteurs a simple way to calculate resale prices and profit on Fetzer productsâ€”from cases, to bottles, to individual glasses.
