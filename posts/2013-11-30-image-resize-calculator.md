Recalculating the size of an image to the correct aspect ratio is not always accurate if we do it off the top of our head. Therefore, the Image Resize Calculator will do this for you. All you have to do is enter the current dimensions of your image and then enter either the new desired width OR the new desired height in order to get the new dimensions.

This app is perfect for developers and designers who need to quickly recalculate the dimension of an image.
