Compare tire and wheel specs conveniently and get recommendations for tire and wheel upgrades. Support both Imperial and Metric units.

This app helps you to choose upgrade tire and wheel safely and wisely, because Safety and Performance both matter!

What makes this app standing out from the crowd: calculate approximate equivalent sprung (chassis) weight difference after changing to a new set of tire+wheel.
