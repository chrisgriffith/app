Discover, subscribe and never miss out on the things you love.
Socialite revolutionises how you keep up with everything that’s happening, from film premieres to sport fixtures; we’ve got it covered.
Socialite works just like a Twitter feed, however instead of seeing what's happening or whats happened, you can see what is going to happen. Think of it as a future facing Twitter where you can see what you have to look forward to.
Unlike other event discovery apps that focus exclusively on ticketing
