The best event discovery app is now at the Google Play store! Easier to use than apps like Waze, Yelp and WeGoOut, 'twoweeks' searches your local area for events happening in the next two weeks. Keep up with your Facebook friends too by plotting their events on a map. So stop moping around in your pj's-- get out there and see what's happening! Stay active and healthy by finding local events in your city and neighboring cities.
