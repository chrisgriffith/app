If you've got your whole house automated, including your kid's rooms, how do you give them control of their environment without giving control over the whole house? Psychic Squid will give them just the right amount of control!
It works with the MicasaVerde Z-wave system and it's really easy to set up. Just put in the name you gave your kids room, and password protect the setup screen and you're all set!
They'll be able to turn their lights, tv's and whatever else you've connected off and on fro
