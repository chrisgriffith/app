This application allows you to monitor your child’s mobile use actions when you are not physically present around, so as to prevent him/her from any bullying/threats or inappropriate online activities. It is designed to keep log of all Incoming/Outgoing Calls and Messages – even if they are removed from the device data. The app will be protected by User defined PIN (Passcode),  and log can be sorted Alphabetically, Recent and Duration (only calls).
