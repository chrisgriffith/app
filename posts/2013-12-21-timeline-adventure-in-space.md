"Timeline Adventure" is a series of educational games that are made with a goal to educate kids and adults alike about interesting world events. We want to show events in perspective and to stimulate players to put these events in the right sequence and by doing so to gain points and new knowledge about different subjects.

You will not find ads in our games, as we think ads only take away attention from what's going on inside the game and they do not provide much value to the player.
