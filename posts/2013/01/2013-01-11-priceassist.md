Help and support your company by cutting costs and saving money when buying from external suppliers!
With PriceAssist you can easily run price checks right from your SAP SRM shopping carts. In case better prices are offered by other suppliers, you can quickly forward this information to the purchasing department.
PriceAssist connects to your company's SRM system and will list the content of your shopping carts of the last 30 days.
