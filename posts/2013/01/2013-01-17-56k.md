The sound of dialing modem always brings back fond memories of the good old days of bbs. This app tries to catch that spirit and by leveraging html, css and javascript experience coupled with the Phonegap framework we were able to do just that. This app was primarily a learning project in the ios/phonegap world so we wanted to create something simple. Since developers in Iceland aren't able to sell apps for android, wp8 or blackberry we're still only on ios (hopefully that will soon change!)
