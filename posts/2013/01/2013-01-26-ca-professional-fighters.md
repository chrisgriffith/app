CAPF approached RIA Mobile Solutions to develop an app for both IOS and Android Platforms to offer their members valuable resources on everything that affects a firefighterâ€™s life on the job. 

We developed a solution using Phonegap, Backbone, HTML5 & CSS3. The app get its content from wordpress cms. We also integrated urban airship with wordpress that way administrators can send push notifications to the app right from the wordpress on any content.
