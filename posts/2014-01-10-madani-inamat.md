Shaikh-e-Tareeqat Ameer-e-Ahle Sunnat, the founder of Dawat-e-Islami Allama Maulana Abu Bilal Muhammad Ilyas Attar Qadri Razavi, a great spiritual and knowledgeable personality of the fifteenth century, has provided a comprehensive collection of Shariah and Tariqah, namely Madani Inamat in the form of a questionnaire, based on how to perform good deeds and refrain from sins in this sinful era. The IT Majlis of Dawat-e-Islami is privileged to present these Madani Inamat with a mobile application.
