GifMe is an app that makes saving, sharing and organizing gifs easier. Started as a chrome extension, then ported to Safari and now available on iOS and Android.

The app syncs your library of gifs in the cloud so you can access them at any time anywhere. Easy tagging system lets you quickly search for the gif / image to share, then copying the link is as simple as a click.
