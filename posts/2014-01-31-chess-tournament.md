Chess Tournament™ is a tournament management tool, and the best way to create live tournaments. Simply add players, and you’re all set! Keep track of scoring as you go through each round, and save the final results in the included archive. Choose between Swiss tournament setup or Berger tables round robin (all play all). So far the only app of its kind!

Built with AngularJS and the CSS from Ionic Framework.
