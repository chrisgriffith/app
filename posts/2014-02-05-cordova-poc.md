Cordova-POC has been created to help to do demo of your Cordova/Phonegap app to customer on-the-fly. 
Idea is to connect multiple sources (online & offline) from which download HTML5 application's bundle.
You can package your demo app as zip file and put it on Dropbox or develop it directly on JSFiddle downloading it when you ready.
Moreover Cordova-POC collects the deployed applications, providing a personal applications gallery, always ready to run.
