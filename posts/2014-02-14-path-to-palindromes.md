Find the path to numbers that read the same backwards as forwards! Tap your way to spotting the largest palindromes you can in a grid to maximize your score. But you, of course, better hurry - because time is always ticking away. The game is simple - find digits that are adjacent or diagonal from one another on the game board, and connect them to make a palindrome. The more you find… and the bigger the palindromes… the higher you score!
