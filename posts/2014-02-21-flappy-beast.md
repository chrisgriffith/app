"It was flapping around, and everybody was having so much fun!  
What nobody knows, is that the fun is so much better after the death!"

Flappy Beast was developed using HTML5 Canvas for game dynamics and CSS3 transitions/transforms for UI. With Phonegap/Cordova, we could modularize and specify exactly the native needed resources. As result, our app has only 1MB and is smaller compared with any other apps of this type.
