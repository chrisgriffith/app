Get TRIFORM and discover a great new puzzle game with a unique concept! By the way, it trains you spatial perception.

DESCRIPTION:
The goal is simple. Move all tiles to their destination. You have two types of movement to achieve this: flipping and rotating. To solve the more complex levels you will need to connect these tiles in order to move them in groups to their destinations.
