FilePopper is a web based file sharing service. You can easily share any file without uploading it on the webserver. FilePopper doesn't store your files - they go directly to addressee.
Select the file you want to share and you will get short URL (can be sent by SMS or email) and QR-code which can be scanned with FilePopper App too. Don't close the Application until file is downloaded! The link will be available for 1 hour.
