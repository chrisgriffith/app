A New FREE Way to Look at NHL Boxscores!
No more old-fashion, tabular grids.  Now you can "see" what happened, instantly and intuitively!
* Goals positioned relative to the time in the period they were scored!
* Goal types are color coded - red power plays, yellow short-handed, purple penalty shots, etc.!
* Scoring bubbles expand to reveal assists and exact time!
* Shootout detail reveals who scored, and in what order!
* Live games updated near-real time!
* More features coming soon!
