ScanYourCards is a small application that makes it easy to save a contact from a business card, thanks to the character recognition. The process is done in 3 steps:
1 - select the source of the image of the card
2 - select zone of name, email and phone number, from picture
3 - save your contact
The application requires no internet connection and contact registration occurs only locally on the phone. The application is multi-lingual, English and French for the moment.
