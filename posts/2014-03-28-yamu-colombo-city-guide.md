YAMU is a guide to the city of Colombo, and Sri Lanka. It provides curated reviews and news of the best and latest places to eat, drink, see as well as a listing of events.

The app helps you find places nearby as well as offering an advanced search (if, say, you want to find a vegetarian friendly place that's good for breakfast).

It also generally helps you find and dial phone numbers and get a sense of what's happening in and around our great city.
