With this simple and easy to use proximity alarm, you no longer need to worry about missing your stop. Just punch in your final destination and this app will use GPS to sound an alarm when you get close to it. 
Now you can wake up from your nap by the time the bus is getting close to your house, you can focus on reading your book, studying for your final or playing your favorite game rather than looking up every five minutes.

Built on web technologies with a lot of care in perf. and UX.
