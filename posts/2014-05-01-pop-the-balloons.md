Your goal is simple: pop as many balloons as possible and thereby collect as many points as possible. Faster balloons award you with more points. To make things a bit more difficult, every balloon that travels outside the top of the screen without being popped reduces your time. You can get more time by popping balloons with a clock symbol. You should avoid popping purple balloons, as they reduce your points. Popping a balloon with a skull symbol ends the game.
