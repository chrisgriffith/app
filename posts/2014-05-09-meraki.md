This app lets you monitor your Cisco Meraki wireless, switch, or security appliance networks from your iOS or Android device. View the status of your wireless network at a glance, quickly identifying healthy or offline access points. See the details of any Meraki access point on your network and use live tools to verify network connectivity. Monitoring another Meraki network is as easy as selecting it right from the app.
