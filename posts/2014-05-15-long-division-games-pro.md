The Long Division Games Pro is an app made for the children who are learning division. The app makes learning and practising division fun, stress free and simple. 
The interesting part is that this app is compatible with smart phones and tablets. Apart from this, the app is divided into 3 memorable steps or guidelines that children and parents can see when they operate the app for the first time.
