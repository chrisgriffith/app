This app requires the mobile device (phone or tablet) owner to login to the Windows domain (active directory) from the mobile device before files can be copied onto the mobile device from the Windows computer they attached the mobile device to (via a USB cable).  This app provides an additional layer of security when using the mobile device as storage.
