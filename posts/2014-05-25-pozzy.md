Pozzy is a geo-location based social game. Its intention is to get everyone out of their homes, meet new people, explore new places and gain new experiences.

How to play:
1) Go somewhere.
2) Search the name of the establishment in Pozzy
3) "Conquer"
4) Profit!

Pozzy will notify you when someone:
- tries to Conquer a place you've visited
- has overthrown you
- wants to "Assemble" at a place you're interested in

This is my first app created with the Cordova/Phonegap framework.
