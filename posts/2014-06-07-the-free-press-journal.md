The Free Press Journal is one of the oldest English Daily newspapers from Mumbai with a heritage of 83 years of publication. And yet, The Free Press Journal is a contemporary paper and rooted in current urban realities. In keeping with the international trend,it has reinvented itself in terms of design, get up and content. It means different thing to different people â€“ a platform for the articulate, a trendsetter for the young and a chronicle for the old.
