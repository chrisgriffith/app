A fast, simple time-lapse calculator that allows you to determine the shutter interval (time between shots) that is required to achieve a desired video clip length for a given recording duration. Most time-lapse utilities ask you to enter the recording duration and shutter interval. Then they calculate the duration of the video clip that would result. This may be useful on occasion, but most of the time itâ€™s backwards.
