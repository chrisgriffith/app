Salient Solutions has created Mobilite, an app that allows business to mobilize their existing applications without coding. Mobilite is a business productivity system that empowers employees with secure and controlled access to a company's data and systems, so they can work effectively from both within and out of the office. By using PhoneGap we were able to produce a single build that works across multiple platforms and device types.
