Each year at Pentecost, the Christian Organisation 'Opwekking' organizes the 4 days in length 'Opwekking Conference'. In 2014 about 60.000 people visited this conference.

The Opwekking App is the free electronic magazine containing the full program in text and timeline mode, an interactive map of the conference area (with GPS), photo albums, user comments area and more.

The App was installed about about 14.500 times.

It is on iOS and Android but this tool refuses my iTunes link.
