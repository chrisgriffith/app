The spookiness of the night is now thwarted with ScareProof. Inside one app, kids will have a multi-tool to combat the worries of the night. ScareProof is a room scanner and monster deterrent. First, kids can activate the ScareSpray to ward off any evil doers they think are in their room. Next, they have two methods of scanning their room to assure no baddies are there, radar scan and picture scan. There is also a Nightlight Mode to turn the app off at a time an adult sets.
