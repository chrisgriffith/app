Augur is an iPhone app that attempts to use Twitter to tell the future. At times an oracle, at times a drunk advice columnist, the app distills the ramblings of the world at large into your own, personal crystal ball. 

In Roman times, an augur was someone who divined the future by studying the flight path of birds. The Augur app is a modern manifestation of this role, looking to Twitter instead of the sky.
