Agadeta Games presents the Temple Timeline!

It is a unique game that was made possible with collaboration of The Temple Institute. Years of research by Rav Yisrael Ariel, the founder of The Temple Institute (Machon HaMikdash) were put into preparing one of the kind pictures that for the first time ever are now featured in iPad app.

Our game presents these unique pictures of historical events, connected to the Holy Jewish Temple, from the period of the creation of the World up until our days. T
