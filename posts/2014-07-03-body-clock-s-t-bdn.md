Biological Clock, a popular term for an internal regulator responsible for various cyclical responses in living things. Both plants and animals show yearly, monthly, daily, and other rhythmic changes that appear to be genetically programmed. Daily rhythms are called circadian rhythms (from the Latin circa dies, "about a day"). Research suggests that mammals have a biological clock that it is located in the hypothalamus of the brain, in a small area called the supra-chiasmatic nucleus.
