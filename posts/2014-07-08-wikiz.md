Wikiz uses Wikipedia content to offer an almost unlimited number of quizzes in all languages. You can play existing quizzes (currently almost 2000!!!), but you can also create new ones on literally ANY topic (cat breeds, football players, Japanese cuisine, German Bundeskanzler, Mercedes vehicles, Airbus aircraftâ€¦), and share them with the community.
