The Samaja is an Oriya daily newspaper published in Cuttack, Odisha, India; started in 1919, it is one of the oldest papers in this region. Utkalamani Gopabandhu Das, a prominent freedom fighter and social worker started it as a weekly from Satyabadi of Puri district of Odisha to facilitate the freedom struggle and to revive the moribund Oriya language. Under Gopabandhu's leadership, and with the support of local people, the paper grew into prominence.
