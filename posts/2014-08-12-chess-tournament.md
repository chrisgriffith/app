From the country of Magnus Carlsen: The only chess tournament tool you’ll ever need. Professional match setup, scoring and rating management done right. Chess Tournament App™ is the only app of its kind, and more: it’s capable of competing with conventional pc software as well - for less than a tenth of the price.
