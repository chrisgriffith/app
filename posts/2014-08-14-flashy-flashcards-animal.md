Flashy Flashcards Animal is a flashcard app that helps your kids learn to read the animals. It comes with fun background song and cute animal illustration. Slide left or right to move from card to card. Tap on the card to flip it and reveal the animal. You will hear my son and daughter read the word for the animal when you tap on the word. My kids and I had fun building and recording this. Read along with your kids, and have a great time.
