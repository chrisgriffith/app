Dgrees a small utility app with a brain hacking twist. Itâ€™s a visual, gestures and colors based Celsius and Fahrenheit converter with the goal for you to stop using converters altogether. It teaches you to convert on your own with a 6-point-reference method - no math formulas, no drilling, no memory overload.
