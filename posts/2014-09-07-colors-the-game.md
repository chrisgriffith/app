colors is not only about having fast fingers, because we know you have. This game is about not getting tricked by your head.

Train your brain to concentrate on the relevant things and ignore the irrelevant.
The concept is quite easy: tap 25 times on the announced color as fast as you can. But remember: donâ€™t get tricked by your head.
