Spell is an Android smartphone app that decomposes the input text into individual characters and provides a simplified view mode to browse them as a magnifier also allowing TTS pronunciation of the 0-255 unicode range. It has handy big paste button to retrieve clipboad copied text, or text can be shared towards the app directly. Four different spelling modes are available in five languages, each language uses its own telephonic alphabet for uppercase latin letters. Supports Samsung MultiWindow.
