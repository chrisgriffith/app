myRecovery is an app to assist recovering addicts. Regardless of the addiction, this app can assist you with getting the help you need, when you need it. Find 12-step meetings, and record journal entries (both text and audio) that you can reflect upon later, or email to service providers. Quickly resources such as the 12 steps, traditions, promises, and prayers. Receive affirmations and when boredom sets in, the app will even recommend one of your favorite activities to do! All of this and more!
