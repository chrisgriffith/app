Poacht is a mobile app for candidates to covertly find new career opportunities without their friends, colleagues, or current employer knowing. Create an account using your Linkedin profile, enter how much money you want to make, where you want to work, and how serious you are about leaving. Poacht periodically runs an algorithm to match you with open positions on the platform. No applying, no resumes, no middleman recruiters. You'll get a buzz when an employer wants to meet you.
