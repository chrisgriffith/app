A simple way to arrange a date with your friends or colleagues that everyone can make. You create an event like a night out, select the dates from our easy calendar and invite the people you would like to join you. They then select the dates they can make and we do the rest by letting you know which dates have the most amount of people available. No more emails or texts back and forth trying to get everyone free on the same day. Organize a 100 people event in just a few clicks.
