Forget the old alphabet puzzles or entertaining videos that don’t truly teach! The Alphabet Song Game™ is the easiest way for students to learn the alphabet. The collection of 22 fun, easy-to-play games teaches students the names and shapes of both uppercase and lowercase letters. It also helps students distinguish between similar looking letters, mirrored letters, and reverse letters. Students can play independently or with a parent or teacher.
