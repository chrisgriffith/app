Spell decomposes the input text into individual characters and provides a simplified view mode to browse them one by one as a magnifier, in addition each character is associated with a descriptive text intelligible by the TTS engine to allow the correct pronunciation of complex string that do not form common words, particularly the Latin letters from A to Z in upper case are associated with the values of the English Telephone Alphabet, based on the US Financial standard (Adam, Bob , etc.).
