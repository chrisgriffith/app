Skimmin is the simplest way to keep up with current events. It's perfect for busy people.

Every day we publish a fresh digest of anything major that happened in the news. These digests generally consist of around 8-10 stories, leaving you with *just* the essential developments.

We then present these select-few stories to you as concise, 325-character summaries, not lengthy articles.
