BarCode is a versatile barcode scanning tool. BarCode saves each entry in a main database. 

User modified entries can be saved to related entries and exported to other devices. Descriptions are entered manually or imported from a master reference file.

Each entry is logged and can be tagged with GPS position data with time stamps.

Scans are organized in "Lists". Import and export lists as a CSV file to use it in your favorite spreadsheet processor.
