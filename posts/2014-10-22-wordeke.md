WordEke (pronounced word-ek-a) is a word-square game like no other. You can choose the difficulty of words used and how much help you receive in finding the right letter combinations.

It's great fun and educational whether you've just started learning English or are a native speaker with an extensive vocabulary.

A range of US & UK dictionaries can be selected, ranging in size from 850 basic English words to almost 350,000 words and common abbreviations.
