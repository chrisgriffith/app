This is the official tour guide for the city San Carlos de Bariloche. It was built on top of PhoneGap, it has more than 1000 companies and a lot of points of interest also it offers an offline map rendering (MapsForge on Android, OpenStreetPad on iOS). Thanks to the plugin modulation it is possible to mix native and web features. In this case, the map is rendered in native code from the vector maps (300KB per city) then it gets exported to the Web View for Leaflet.js to display the tiles.
