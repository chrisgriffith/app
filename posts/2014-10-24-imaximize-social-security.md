The iMaximize Social Security calculator only requires a few inputs to help navigate through the convoluted Social Security rules to select the userâ€™s optimal filing strategy. The calculator is uniquely tailored to the user by considering individual life expectancy, age, personal insurance amount (PIA), marital status, and current filing status. In addition to being a powerful calculation tool, this App includes a resource library which offers a wealth of pertinent Social Security information.
