I ♥ Indie brings independent music to your ears. It is a web radio service similar to Pandora, except that you'll only hear brand new music from unsigned bands. You can select genres or set up playlists to hear what you want.

The I ♥ Indie service allows artists to directly upload their songs and design their albums. You, the listener, get a stream of the creations that fit your taste. You can choose to support the band by rating their work, sharing with your friends, or purchasing their song.
