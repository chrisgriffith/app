FairShare keeps track of how much of the tasks you complete at home or at work. The new version has improved functionality and is even more easy to use.

Decide which tasks you want to use in FairShare together and how many points they are worth. You can also add challenges for your tasks left undone. When a challenge is completed it will disappear from the list and the person performing the task gets the points.
You can play by connecting iPads, iPhones or iPods, or by using one device.
