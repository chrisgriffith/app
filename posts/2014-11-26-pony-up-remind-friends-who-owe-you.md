Pony Up App is your new personal debt collector. Hate asking to be paid back? Or, sick of people not paying you back? Pony Up App handles this problem for you by keeping track of who owes you and automatically sending reminders to pay you.  The only thing you have to do is record when you lend someone money and mark when they pay you.
