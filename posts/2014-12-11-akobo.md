Akobo is a word game, the object of which is to build words using the jumbled-up letter blocks (Kobos), in the shortest possible time. It’s an addictive game with two difficulty levels and an infinite number of combinations. 

The free version has a limited amount of words, and new word packages can be purchased at the Store. 
It’s great for sharpening your concentration level and visual skills, as you learn to quickly find combinations which change each time around.
