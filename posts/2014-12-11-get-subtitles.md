Download subtitles for your favorite movies, shows and sitcoms easily with Get Subtitles.

The app scans your phone for video files, and then lets you select which ones you would like the subtitles for. There is over 100 languages available. The subtitles are downloaded from the OpenSubtitles server, and uses their hashing function to accurately predict which subtitle will suit your movie or video the best.
