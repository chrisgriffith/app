If you love interval training, you need interval. Whether you do HIIT, MMA, Tabata, crossfit or your own custom routine, interval will have you up and running in no time.

Create routines with the activities you would like to perform along with the duration and rest time for each one. Once your routine is created you can quickly start the session and interval will instruct you from there both on screen and by voice.
