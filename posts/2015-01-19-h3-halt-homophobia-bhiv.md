H3: Halt Homophobia & HIV is an app I built for ARCH, an HIV/AIDS Resources & Community Health group in Guelph, ON. I had built the initial version of the app, and redesigned it visually to be in line with a recent site design (archguelph.ca) while adding some features. The app offers tips on how to eliminate homophobia, as well as dispelling myths about HIV. 

It's available for iOS and Android, and was built with Angular and jQuery.
