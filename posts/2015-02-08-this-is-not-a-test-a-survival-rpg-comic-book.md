"This Is Not a Test" is a mutation between a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure-styled comic book and an RPG-like survival game. All graphics are hand-illustrated by comic artist Jeff Edwards, in a gritty, post-apocalyptic style with a truly unique feel. The writing is blunt, pulpy, and cruel, hurling you into the skin of a victim racing for survival in the final moments of humanity. The Android version is done with HTML5 and PhoneGap, using CSS3 for animations. Making this was a great experience!
