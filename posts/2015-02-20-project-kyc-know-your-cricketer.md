I have created this app just to show case the awesomeness of phonegap when combined properly with the magic JS/HTML5/CSS3 

This application , basically contains the all and everything about Player's history in WorldcupCricket

I have used following tools and technology:
Phonega CLI,localbuild,
JS [ JQueryMobile,JQuery ], HTML5,
CSS3 ( pureCSS , JQuery Mobile UI),
SQLCipher(SQLite),
Python,Scrapy,Peewee for data part
and GIT(bitbucket)
Tools : Intellij IDEA
Distribution : Ubuntu Utopic Unicorn
