SecureSleep turns your phone or tablet into a personal security device. It watches your surroundings while you sleep, alarms loudly if it detects an intruder, and summons help. It's easy to use: Turn the device to landscape, select the area to monitor on the camera preview, then go to sleep. If the motion sensor detects an intruder, it emits a load alarm, turns on the flash, strobes the screen, and summons help. The Help message includes a description, pictures, sound recording, location, map.
