100CUBES is a puzzle game where the player tries to fill as many cubes in a level as possible. However, they cannot move to a filled cube again. As the game progresses, it becomes increasingly difficult to find a place to move to and if the player succeeds to fill certain number of cubes, they progress to next level. If they fail... well, we have a nicely animated defeat screen which they can apreciate!
Also features online scoreboard and is completely FREE.
