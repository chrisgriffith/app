Sworkit is a workout app that provides guided, video-based workouts that you can do anywhere and anytime. Sworkit dynamically assembles exercise routines that can fit any time constraint from as little as 5 minutes to over 60 minutes, by merging high quality video content with audio guidance recorded in 13 different languages. Without needing to think heavily, users can easily follow along to the professional video and audio, and even skip an exercise they find challenging while still maintaining the length of their workout. At Sworkit, PhoneGap and hybrid development is overwhelming regarded as a competitive advantage. Originally created by just a single developer, Sworkit has been downloaded over 4 million times with users completing over of 7 million minutes of exercise each month. This exceptional growth is credited to the rapid development, testing and distribution that hybrid development provides this very small team compared to its competitors. Sworkit has been featured by the Apple App Store, Google Play, Amazon Appstore, Samsung Apps and Xiaomi Market.
