Gartic is an online drawing game in which players have to guess what the other players are drawing. With up to 10 participants per room, at the start of every round, a player is chosen to draw a random word, while the other players have to try and guess it. The first player to score more than 120 points wins.
 
Choose a theme of words of your preference (General, Objects, Food, Animals, Verbs or Professions) and have fun for free!
