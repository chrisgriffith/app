A simple timer app to create custom interval workouts. This timer app could be used for both home or gym workouts. Excellent for HIIT, tabata, crossfit, weight exercises or calisthenics.

In contrast to other workout timers, this app gives voice instructions for each exercise. Therefor, you never have to stop and check what exactly you have to do next and if you ever forget how to execute a complicated exercise you can check instruction while doing a workout.
