Backseat, share the vibe of a ride, is the first ride sharing solution operating down under, in Sydney, Australia.

The initiative came from two young entrepreneur, one mostly focusing on the business and operation side, the other on the solution design, and product delivery. They soon have followed by a great designer and marketing person.

Phonegap was obvious, due to the necessity of going fast, and the duty to deliver a similar experience on multiple channels, iOS and Android.
