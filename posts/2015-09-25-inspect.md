Inspect is an interesting way to communicate with your friends and anonymous users when you need the most. You can ask/share your queries/updates to see your friendâ€™s responses, poll to your friends & anonymous users on visuals, doubts, confusions, curiosities, issues etc to know their opinions. You can also get the suggestions from your friends or anonymous users for any services which you are looking for.
