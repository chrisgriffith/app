Spectrum: Connection to Color takes connecting dots to a whole new level! Work through challenging puzzles by linking dots and discovering new colors. Each level provides tricky obstacles and colorful conundrums.

Puzzle progression starts out simple, introducing the player to the basics of connecting small dots to their matching big dot without overlapping lines, but quickly introduces a new idea: What happens when you connect two different colors?
