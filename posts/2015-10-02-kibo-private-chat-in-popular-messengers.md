Have you ever tried to type a text message while someone was looking over your shoulder? A new keyboard called Kibo realizes that your privacy is important. Whether you are in the office using Skype or at home using Facebook Messenger, this secretive way of communicating is just what you need. Kibo works with many popular services such as Viber, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, WeChat, Skype, and more, including iMessage. You can also send non-secretive messages with Kibo.
