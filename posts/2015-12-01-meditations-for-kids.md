Think back to your childhood: wouldn’t it have been wonderful to learn how to relax and stay calm in stressful situations when you were growing up? You can give your children this gift by meditating with them. If you’re new to meditation, it may be intimidating at first, but don’t worry – your child is likely a natural. When it comes to learning the art of meditation and guided imagery, children may truly have an advantage over adults – unbridled, beautiful imaginations.
